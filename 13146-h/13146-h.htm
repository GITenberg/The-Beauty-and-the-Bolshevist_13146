    <h2>Chapter I</h2>

    <p>The editor of that much-abused New York daily,
    <i>Liberty</i>, pushed back his editorial typewriter and opened
    one letter in the pile which the office-boy&mdash;no respecter
    of persons&mdash;had just laid upon the desk while whistling a
    piercing tune between his teeth.</p>

    <p>The letter said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>DEAR BEN,&mdash;I hate to think what your feelings will
        be on learning that I am engaged to be married to a
        daughter of the capitalistic class. Try to overcome your
        prejudices, however, and judge Eugenia as an individual and
        not as a member of a class. She has very liberal ideas,
        reads your paper, and is content to go with me to Monroe
        College and lead the life of an instructor's wife. You will
        be glad to know that Mr. Cord disapproves as much as you
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page2"
           id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>do, and will not give his
           daughter a cent, so that our life will be as hard on the
           physical side as you in your most affectionate moments
           could desire. Mr. Cord is under the impression that
           lack of an income will cool my ardor. You see he could
           not think worse of me if he were my own brother.</p>

        <p>Yours,</p>

        <p>DAVID.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The fine face of the editor darkened. It was the face of an
    idealist&mdash;the deep-set, slowly changing eyes, the high
    cheek bones, but the mouth closed firmly, almost obstinately,
    and contradicted the rest of the face with a touch of
    aggressiveness, just as in Lincoln's face the dreamer was
    contradicted by the shrewd, practical mouth. He crossed his
    arms above the elbow so that one long hand dangled on one side
    of his knees and one on the other&mdash;a favorite pose of
    his&mdash;and sat thinking.</p>

    <p>The editor was often called a Bolshevist&mdash;as who is not
    in these days? For language is given us not only to conceal
    thought, but often to prevent it, and every now and then when
    the problems of the world become too complex and too vital,
    some one stops all thought on a subject by inventing a tag,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page3"
       id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>like "witch" in the seventeenth
       century, or "Bolshevist" in the twentieth.</p>

    <p>Ben Moreton was not a Bolshevist; indeed, he had written
    several editorials to show that, in his opinion, their
    doctrines were not sound, but of course the people who
    denounced him never thought of reading his paper. He was a
    socialist, a believer in government ownership, and, however
    equably he attempted to examine any dispute between capital and
    labor, he always found for labor. He was much denounced by
    ultraconservatives, and perhaps their instinct was sound, for
    he was educated, determined, and possessed of a personality
    that attached people warmly, so that he was more dangerous than
    those whose doctrines were more militant. He was not wholly
    trusted by the extreme radicals. His views were not
    consistently agreeable to either group. For instance, he
    believed that the conscientious objectors were really
    conscientious, a creed for which many people thought he ought
    to be deported. On the other hand, he doubted that Wall Street
    had started the war for its own purposes, a skepticism which
    made some of his friends think him just fit for a
    bomb.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"
       id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>

    <p>The great problem of his life was how to hold together a
    body of liberals so that they could be effective. This problem
    was going to be immensely complicated by the marriage of his
    brother with the daughter of a conspicuous capitalist like
    William Cord.</p>

    <p>He pushed the buzzer on his desk and wrote out the following
    telegram:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>David Moreton, Care William Cord, Newport, R.I.</p>

        <p>Am taking boat Newport to-night. Meet me.</p>

        <p>Ben.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>No one answered his buzzer, but presently a boy came in
    collecting copy, and Moreton said to him:</p>

    <p>"Here, get this sent, and ask Klein to come here. He's in
    the composing room."</p>

    <p>And presently Mr. Klein entered, in the characteristic dress
    of the newspaper man&mdash;namely, shirt sleeves and a green
    shade over his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Look here, Ben!" he exclaimed in some excitement. "Here's a
    thousand-dollar check just come in for the strike fund. How's
    that for the second day?"</p>

    <p>"Good enough," said Ben, who would
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page5"
       id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>ordinarily have put in a good
       hour rejoicing over such unexpected good fortune, but whose
       mind was now on other things. "I have to go out of town
       to-night. You'll be here, won't you, to lock the presses?
       And, see here, Leo, what is the matter with our book
       page?"</p>

    <p>"Pretty rotten page," replied Klein.</p>

    <p>"I should say it was&mdash;all about taxes and strikes and
    economic crises. I told Green never to touch those things in
    the book reviews. Our readers get all they want of that from us
    in the news and the editorials&mdash;hotter, better stuff, too.
    I've told him not to touch 'em in the book page, and he runs
    nothing else. He ought to be beautiful&mdash;ought to talk
    about fairies, and poetry, and twelfth-century art. What's the
    matter with him?"</p>

    <p>"He doesn't know anything," said Klein. "That's his trouble.
    He's clever, but he doesn't know much. I guess he only began to
    read books a couple years ago. They excite him too much. He
    wouldn't read a fairy story. He'd think he was wasting
    time."</p>

    <p>"Get some one to help him out."</p>

    <p>"Who'd I get?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page6"
       id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>

    <p>"Look about. I've got to go home and pack a bag. Ask Miss
    Cox what time that Newport boat leaves."</p>

    <p>"Newport! Great heavens, Ben! What is this? A little
    week-end?"</p>

    <p>"A little weak brother, Leo."</p>

    <p>"David in trouble again?"</p>

    <p>Moreton nodded. "He thinks he's going to marry William
    Cord's daughter."</p>

    <p>Klein, who was Ben's friend as well as his assistant,
    blanched at the name.</p>

    <p>"Cord's daughter!" he exclaimed, and if he had said
    Jack-the-ripper's, he could not have expressed more horror.
    "Now isn't it queer," he went on, musingly, "that David,
    brought up as he has been, can see anything to attract him in a
    girl like that?"</p>

    <p>Ben was tidying his desk preparatory to departure&mdash;that
    is to say, he was pushing all the papers far enough back to
    enable him to close the roller top, and he answered,
    absently:</p>

    <p>"Oh, I suppose they're all pretty much the
    same&mdash;girls."</p>

    <p>"Why, what do you mean?" said Leo, reproachfully. "How can a
    girl who's been brought up to be a parasite&mdash;to display
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7"
       id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>wealth of her father and
       husband, and has never done a useful thing since she was
       born&mdash;Why, a woman was telling me the other day&mdash;I
       got caught in a block in the subway and she was next
       me&mdash;awfully interesting, she was. She sewed in one of
       these fashionable dressmaking establishments&mdash;and the
       things she told me about what those women spend on their
       clothes&mdash;underclothes and furs and everything. Now
       there must be something wrong with a woman who can spend
       money on those things when she knows the agony of poverty
       right around her. You can't compare that sort of woman with
       a self-respecting, self-supporting girl&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At this moment the door opened and Miss Cox entered. She
    wore a short-sleeved, low-neck, pink-satin blouse, a
    white-satin skirt, open-work stockings, and slippers so high in
    the heels that her ankles turned inward. Her hair was treated
    with henna and piled untidily on the top of her head. She was
    exactly what Klein had described&mdash;a self-respecting,
    self-supporting girl, but, on a superficial acquaintance, men
    of Cord's group would have thought quite as badly of her as
    Klein did of fashionable women.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"
       id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>They would have been mistaken.
       Miss Cox supported her mother, and, though only seventeen,
       denied herself all forms of enjoyment except dress and an
       occasional movie. She was conscientious, hard-working,
       accurate, and virtuous. She loved Ben, whom she regarded as
       wise, beautiful, and generous, but she would have died
       rather than have him or anyone know it.</p>

    <p>She undulated into the room, dropped one hip lower than the
    other, placed her hand upon it and said, with a good deal of
    enunciation:</p>

    <p>"Oh, Mr. Moreton, the Newport boat leaves at
    five-thirty."</p>

    <p>"Thank you very much, Miss Cox," said Ben, gravely, and she
    went out again.</p>

    <p>"It would be a terrible thing for Dave to make a marriage
    like that," Klein went on as soon as she had gone, "getting
    mixed up with those fellows. And it would be bad for you,
    Ben&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I don't mean to get mixed up with them," said Ben.</p>

    <p>"No, I mean having Dave do it. It would kill the paper; it
    would endanger your whole position; and as for leadership, you
    could never
    hope&mdash;"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"

    </center>

    <p>"Now, look here, Leo. You don't think I can stop my
    brother's marrying because it might be a poor connection for
    me? The point is that it wouldn't be good for Dave&mdash;to be
    a poorly tolerated hanger-on. That's why I'm going hot-foot to
    Newport. And while I'm away do try to do something about the
    book page. Get me a culture-hound&mdash;get one of these Pater
    specialists from Harvard. Or," he added, with sudden
    inspiration when his hand was already on the door, "get a
    woman&mdash;she'd have a sense of beauty and would know how to
    jolly Green into agreeing with her." And with this the editor
    was gone.</p>

    <p>It was the end of one of those burning weeks in August that
    New York often knows. The sun went down as red as blood every
    evening behind the Palisades, and before the streets and roofs
    had ceased to radiate heat the sun was up again above Long
    Island Sound, as hot and red as ever. As Ben went uptown in the
    Sixth Avenue Elevated he could see pale children hanging over
    the railings of fire escapes, and behind them catch glimpses of
    dark, crowded rooms which had all the disadvantages of caves
    without the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"
       id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>coolness. But to-day he was
       too concentrated on his own problem to notice.</p>

    <p>Since Ben's sixteenth year his brother David had been
    dependent on him. Their father had been professor of economics
    in a college in that part of the United States which Easterners
    describe as the "Middle West." In the gay days when muck-raking
    was at its height Professor Moreton had lost his chair because
    he had denounced in his lecture room financial operations which
    to-day would be against the law. At that time they were well
    thought of, and even practiced by the eminent philanthropist
    who had endowed the very chair which Moreton occupied. The
    trustees felt that it was unkind and unnecessary to complicate
    their already difficult duties by such tactlessness, and their
    hearts began to turn against Moreton, as most of our hearts
    turn against those who make life too hard for us. Before long
    they asked him to resign on account of his age&mdash;he was
    just sixty and extremely vigorous; but immediately afterward,
    having been deeply surprised and hurt, he did what Goldsmith
    recommends to lovely woman under not dissimilar
    circumstances&mdash;he died. He
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"
       id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>left his two young
       sons&mdash;he had married late in life&mdash;absolutely
       unprovided for. Ben, the elder of the two, was sixteen, and
       just ready for college; but he could not give four precious
       years to an academic degree. He went to work. With the
       background of an educated environment and a very sound
       knowledge of economic questions, breathed in from his
       earliest days, he found a place at once on a new
       paper&mdash;or, rather, on an old paper just being converted
       into a new organ of liberalism&mdash;<i>Liberty</i>. It was
       independent in politics, and was supposed to be independent
       in economic questions, but by the time Ben worked up to the
       editorship it was well recognized to be an anticapitalist
       sheet. The salary of its editor, though not large, was
       sufficient to enable him to send his younger brother through
       college, with the result that David, a little weak, a little
       self-indulgent, a little&mdash;partly through physical
       causes&mdash;disinclined to effort, was now a poet, a
       classicist and an instructor in a fresh-water college. Ben
       made him an allowance to enable him to live&mdash;the
       college not thinking this necessary for its instructors. But
       during the war Ben had not been able to manage the
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12"
       id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>allowance, because, to the
       surprise of many of his friends, Ben had volunteered
       early.</p>

    <p>Although the reasons for doing this seemed absurdly simple
    to him, the decision had been a difficult one. He was a
    pacifist&mdash;saw no virtue in war whatsoever. He wished to
    convert others to his opinion&mdash;unlike many reformers who
    prefer to discuss questions only with those who already agree
    with them. He argued that the speeches of a man who had been
    through war, or, better still, the posthumous writings of one
    who has been killed in war, would have more weight with the
    public than the best logic of one who had held aloof. But his
    radical friends felt that he was using this argument merely as
    an excuse for choosing the easy path of conformity, while the
    few ultraconservatives who mentioned the matter at all assumed
    that he had been drafted against his will. Afterward, when the
    war was over and his terrible book, <i>War</i>, appeared, no
    one was pleased, for the excellent reason that it was published
    at a moment when the whole world wanted to forget war entirely.
    The pay of a private, however, had not allowed him to continue
    David's allowance, and so David,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"
       id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>displaying unusual energy, had
       found a job for himself as tutor for the summer to William
       Cord's son. Ben had not quite approved of a life that seemed
       to him slightly parasitical, but it was healthy and quiet
       and, above everything, David had found it for himself, and
       initiative was so rare in the younger man that Ben could not
       bear to crush it with disapproval.</p>

    <p>Increasingly, during the two years he was in France, Ben was
    displeased by David's letters. The Cords were described as
    kindly, well-educated people, fond one of another, considerate
    of the tutor, with old-fashioned traditions of American
    liberties. Ben asked himself if he would have been better
    pleased if David's employers had been cruel, vulgar, and
    blatant, and found the answer was in the affirmative. It would,
    he thought, have been a good deal safer for David's integrity
    if he had not been so comfortable.</p>

    <p>For two summers Ben had made no protest, but the third
    summer, when the war was over and the allowance again possible,
    he urged David not to go back to Newport. David flatly refused
    to yield. He said he saw no reason why he should go on taking
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"
       id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>Ben's money when this simple
       way of earning a full living was open to him. Wasn't Ben's
       whole theory that everyone should be self-supporting? Why
       not be consistent?</p>

    <p>Ignorant people might imagine that two affectionate brothers
    could not quarrel over an issue purely affectionate. But the
    Moretons did quarrel&mdash;more bitterly than ever before, and
    that is saying a great deal. With the extraordinary tenacity of
    memory that develops under strong emotion, they each contrived
    to recall and to mention everything which the other had done
    that was wrong, ridiculous, or humiliating since their earliest
    days. They parted with the impression on David's part that Ben
    thought him a self-indulgent grafter, and on Ben's side that
    David thought him a bully solely interested in imposing his
    will on those unfortunate enough to be dependent on him.</p>

    <p>It was after half past four when, having walked up five
    flights of stairs, he let himself into his modest flat on the
    top floor of an old-fashioned brownstone house. As he opened
    the door, he called,</p>

    <p>"Nora!"</p>

    <p>No beautiful partner of a free-love affair
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"
       id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>appeared, but an elderly woman
       in spectacles who had once been Professor Moreton's cook,
       and now, doing all the housework for Ben, contrived to make
       him so comfortable that the editor of a more radical paper
       than his own had described the flat as "a bourgeois
       interior."</p>

    <p>"Nora," said Ben, "put something in my bag for the
    night&mdash;I'm going to Newport in a few minutes."</p>

    <p>He had expected a flood of questions, for Nora was no
    looker-on at life, and he was surprised by her merely observing
    that she was glad he was getting away from the heat. The truth
    was that she knew far more about David than he did. She had
    consistently coddled David since his infancy, and he told her a
    great deal. Besides, she took care of his things when he was at
    Ben's. She had known of sachets, photographs, and an engraved
    locket that he wore on his watch-chain. She was no radical. She
    had seen disaster come upon the old professor and attributed
    it, not to the narrowness of the trustees, but to the folly of
    the professor. She disapproved of most of Ben's friends, and
    would have despised his paper if she
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"
       id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>ever read it. The only good
       thing about it in her estimation was, he seemed to be able
       "to knock a living out of it"&mdash;a process which Nora
       regarded with a sort of gay casualness. She did not blame
       him for making so little money and thus keeping her
       housekeeping cramped, but she never in her own mind doubted
       that it would be far better if he had more. The idea that
       David was about to marry money seemed to her simply the
       reward of virtue&mdash;her own virtue in bringing David up
       so well. She knew that Mr. Cord opposed the marriage, but
       she supposed that Ben would arrange all that. She had great
       confidence in Ben. Still he was very young, very young, so
       she gave him a word of advice as she put his bag into his
       hand.</p>

    <p>"Don't take any nonsense. Remember you're every bit as good
    as they. Only don't, for goodness' sake, Mr. Ben, talk any of
    your ideas to them. A rich man like Mr. Cord wouldn't like
    that."</p>

    <p>Ben laughed. "How would you like me to bring you home a
    lovely heiress of my own?" he said.</p>

    <p>She took a thread off his coat. "Only
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
       id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>don't let her come interfering
       in my kitchen," she said, and hurried him away. He had a
       good deal of courage, but he had not enough to tell Nora he
       was going to Newport to stop her darling's marriage.</p>

    <p>The Newport boat gets to Newport about two o'clock in the
    morning, and experienced travelers, if any such choose this
    method of approach, go on to Fall River and take a train back
    to Newport, arriving in time for a comfortable nine-o'clock
    breakfast. But Ben was not experienced, and he supposed that
    when you took a boat for Newport and reached Newport the thing
    to do was to get off the boat.</p>

    <p>It had been a wonderful night on the Sound, and Ben had not
    been to bed, partly because, applying late on a Friday evening,
    he had not been able to get a room, but partly because the moon
    and the southerly breeze and the silver shores of Long Island
    and the red and white lighthouses had been too beautiful to
    leave. Besides, he had wanted to think out carefully what he
    was going to say to his brother.</p>

    <p>To separate a man from the woman he loves, however unwisely,
    has some of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"
       id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>same disadvantages as offering
       a bribe&mdash;one respects the other person less in
       proportion as one succeeds. What, Ben said to himself, could
       he urge against a girl he did not know? Yet, on the other
       hand, if he had known her, his objections would have seemed
       regrettably personal. Either way, it was difficult to know
       what to say. He wondered what Cord had said, and smiled to
       think that here was one object for which he and Cord were
       co-operating&mdash;only Cord would never believe it. That
       was one trouble with capitalists&mdash;they always thought
       themselves so damned desirable. And Ben did not stop to
       inquire how it was that capitalists had gained this
       impression.</p>

    <p>On the pier he looked about for David, but there was no
    David. Of course the boy had overslept, or hadn't received his
    telegram&mdash;Ben said this to himself, but somehow the vision
    of David comfortably asleep in a luxurious bed in the Cords's
    house irritated him.</p>

    <p>His meditations were broken in upon by a negro boy with an
    open hack, who volunteered to "take him up for fifty cents." It
    sounded reasonable. Ben got in and they moved slowly down the
    narrow pier, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"
       id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>horses' hoofs clumping lazily
       on the wooden pavement. Turning past the alley of Thames
       Street, still alight at three o'clock in the morning, Ben
       stopped at the suggestion of his driver and left his bag at
       a hotel, and then they went on up the hill, past the tower
       of the Skeleton in Armor, past old houses with tall,
       pillared porticoes, reminiscent of the days when the South
       patronized Newport, and turned into Bellevue
       Avenue&mdash;past shops with names familiar to Fifth Avenue,
       past a villa with bright-eyed owls on the gateposts, past
       many large, silent houses and walled gardens.</p>

    <p>The air was very cool, and now and then the scent of some
    flowering bush trailed like a visible cloud across their path.
    Then suddenly the whole avenue was full of little red lights,
    like the garden in "Faust" when Mephistopheles performs his
    magic on it. Here and there the huge headlights of a car shone
    on the roadway, magnifying every rut in the asphalt, and
    bringing out strange, vivid shades in the grass and the
    hydrangea bushes. They were passing a frowning palace set on a
    piece of velvet turf as small as a pocket handkerchief&mdash;so
    small that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"
       id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>lighted windows were plainly
       visible from the road.</p>

    <p>"Stop," said Ben to his driver. He had suddenly realized how
    long it must be before he could rouse the Cord household.</p>

    <p>He paid his driver, got out, and made his way up the
    driveway toward the house. Groups of chauffeurs were standing
    about their cars&mdash;vigorous, smartly dressed men, young for
    the most part. Ben wondered if it were possible that they were
    content with the present arrangement, and whether their wives
    and children were not stifling in the city at that very moment.
    He caught a sentence here and there as he passed. "And, believe
    me," one was saying, "as soon as he got into the box he did not
    do a thing to that fellar from Tiverton&mdash;" Ben's footsteps
    lagged a little. He was a baseball fan. He almost forgave the
    chauffeurs for being content. They seemed to him human beings,
    after all.</p>

    <p>He approached the house, and, walking past a narrow,
    unroofed piazza, he found himself opposite a long window. He
    looked straight into the ballroom. The ball was a fancy
    ball&mdash;the best of the season. It was called a Balkan Ball,
    which gave all the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
       id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>guests the opportunity of
       dressing pretty much as they pleased. The wood of the long
       paneled room was golden, and softened the light from the
       crystal appliques along the wall, and set off the bright
       dresses of the dancers as a gold bowl sets off the colors of
       fruit.</p>

    <p>Every now and then people stepped out on the piazza, and as
    they did they became audible to Ben for a few seconds. First,
    two middle-aged men, solid, bronzed, laughing rather wickedly
    together. Ben drew back, afraid of what he might overhear, but
    it turned out to be no very guilty secret. "My dear fellow,"
    one was saying, "I gave him a stroke a hole, and he's twenty
    years younger than I am&mdash;well, fifteen anyhow. The trouble
    with these young men is that they lack&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Ben never heard what it was that young men lacked.</p>

    <p>Next came a boy and a girl, talking eagerly, the girl's hand
    gesticulating at her round, red lips. Ben had no scruples in
    overhearing them&mdash;theirs appeared to be the universal
    secret. But here again he was wrong. She was saying: "Round and
    round&mdash;not up and down. My dentist says that if you always
    brush them round and
    round&mdash;"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"
       id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>

    <p>Then two young men&mdash;boys, with cigarettes drooping from
    their lips; they were saying, "I haven't pitched a game since
    before the war, but he said to go in and get that Tiverton
    fellow, and so&mdash;" Ben saw that he was in the presence of
    the hero of the late game. He forgave him, too.</p>

    <p>As a matter of fact, he had never given the fashionable
    world enough attention to hate it. He knew that Leo Klein
    derived a very revivifying antagonism from reading about it,
    and often bought himself an entrance to the opera partly
    because he loved music, but partly, Ben always thought, because
    he liked to look up at the boxes and hate the occupants for
    their jewels and inattention. But Ben watched the spectacle
    with as much detachment as he would have watched a spring dance
    among the Indians.</p>

    <p>And then suddenly his detachment melted away, for a lovely
    girl came through the window&mdash;lovely with that particular
    and specific kind of loveliness which Ben thought of when he
    used the word&mdash;<i>his</i> kind. He used to wonder
    afterward how he had known it at that first glimpse, for, in
    the dim light of the piazza, he could not see some of her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23"
       id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>greatest beauties&mdash;the
       whiteness of her skin, white as milk where her close, fine,
       brown hair began, or the blue of the eyes set at an angle
       which might have seemed Oriental in eyes less enchanting
       turquoise in color. But he could see her slenderness and
       grace. She was dressed in clinging blues and greens and she
       wore a silver turban. She leaned her hands on the
       railings&mdash;she turned them out along the railings; they
       were slender and full of character&mdash;not soft. Ben
       looked at the one nearest him. With hardly more than a turn
       of his head he could have kissed it. The idea appealed to
       him strongly; he played with it, just as when he was a child
       in a college town he had played with the idea of getting up
       in church and walking about on the backs of the pews. This
       would be pleasanter, and the subsequent getaway even easier.
       He glanced at the dark lawn behind him; there appeared to be
       no obstacle to escape.</p>

    <p>Perhaps, under the spell of her attraction for him, and the
    knowledge that he would never see her again, he might actually
    have done it, but she broke the trance by speaking to a tall,
    stolid young man who was with
    her.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24"
       id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>

    <p>"No, Eddie," she said, as if answering something he had said
    some time ago, "I really was at home, at just the time I said,
    only this new butler does hate you so&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"You might speak to him about it&mdash;you might even get
    rid of him," replied the young man, in the tone of one deeply
    imposed upon.</p>

    <p>"Good butlers are so rare nowadays."</p>

    <p>"And are devoted friends so easy to find?"</p>

    <p>"No, but a good deal easier than butlers, Eddie dear."</p>

    <p>The young man gave an exclamation of annoyance. "Let us find
    some place out of the way. I want to speak to you
    seriously&mdash;" he began, and they moved out of
    earshot&mdash;presumably to a secluded spot of Eddie's
    choosing.</p>

    <p>When they had gone Ben felt distinctly lonely, and, what was
    more absurd, slighted, as if Eddie had deliberately taken the
    girl away from him&mdash;out of reach. How silly, he thought,
    for Eddie to want to talk to her, when it was so clear the
    fellow did not know how to talk to her. How silly to say, in
    the sulky tone, "Are devoted friends so easy to find?" Of
    course they were&mdash;for a girl like that&mdash;devoted
    friends, passionate lovers, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"
       id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>sentimental idiots undoubtedly
       blocked her path.</p>

    <p>It might have been some comfort to him to know that in the
    remote spot of his own choosing, a stone bench under a purple
    beech, Eddie was simply going from bad to worse.</p>

    <p>"Dear Crystal," he began, with that irritating
    reasonableness of manner which implies that the speaker is
    going to be reasonable for two, "I've been thinking over the
    situation. I know that you don't love me, but then I don't
    believe you will ever be deeply in love with any one. I don't
    think you are that kind of woman."</p>

    <p>"Oh, Eddie, how dreadful!"</p>

    <p>"I don't see that at all. Just as well, perhaps. You don't
    want to get yourself into such a position as poor Eugenia."</p>

    <p>"I do, I would. I'd give anything to be as much in love as
    Eugenia."</p>

    <p>"What? With a fellow like that! A complete outsider."</p>

    <p>"Outside of what? The human race?"</p>

    <p>"Well, no," said Eddie, as if he were yielding a good deal,
    "but outside of your traditions and your set."</p>

    <p>"My set! Good for him to be outside of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"
       id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>it, I say. What have they ever
       done to make anyone want to be inside of it? Why, David is
       an educated gentleman. To hear him quote Horace&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Horace who?"</p>

    <p>"Really, Eddie."</p>

    <p>"Oh, I see. You mean the poet. That's nothing to laugh at,
    Crystal. It was a natural mistake. I thought, of course, you
    meant some of those anarchists who want to upset the
    world."</p>

    <p>Crystal looked at him more honestly and seriously than she
    had yet done.</p>

    <p>"Well, don't you think there <i>is</i> something wrong with
    the present arrangement of things, Eddie?"</p>

    <p>"No, I don't, and I hate to hear you talk like a
    socialist."</p>

    <p>"I am a socialist."</p>

    <p>"You're nothing of the kind."</p>

    <p>"I suppose I know what I am."</p>

    <p>"Not at all&mdash;not at all."</p>

    <p>"I certainly think the rich are too rich, while the poor are
    so horridly poor."</p>

    <p>"<i>You'd</i> get on well without your maid and your car and
    your father's charge accounts at all the shops, wouldn't
    you?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"
       id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>

    <p>Though agreeable to talk seriously if you agree, it is
    correspondingly dangerous if you disagree. Crystal stood up,
    trembling with an emotion which Eddie, although he was rather
    angry himself, considered utterly unaccountable.</p>

    <p>"Yes," she said, almost proudly, "I <i>am</i> luxurious, I
    <i>am</i> dependent on those things. But whose fault is that?
    It's the way I was brought up&mdash;it's all wrong. But, even
    though I am dependent on them, I believe I could exist without
    them. I'd feel like killing myself if I didn't think so.
    Sometimes I want to go away and find out if I couldn't live and
    be myself without all this background of luxury. But at the
    worst&mdash;I'm just one girl&mdash;suppose I were weak and
    couldn't get on without them? That wouldn't prove that they are
    right. I'm not so blinded that I can't see that a system by
    which I profit may still be absolutely wrong. But you always
    seem to think, Eddie, that it's part of the Constitution of the
    United States that you should have everything you've always
    had."</p>

    <p>Eddie rose, too, with the manner of a man who has allowed
    things to go far enough. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"
       id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>"Look here, my dear girl," he
       said, "I am a man and I'm older than you, and have seen more
       of the world. I know you don't mean any harm, but I must
       tell you that this is very wicked, dangerous talk."</p>

    <p>"Dangerous, perhaps, Eddie, but I can't see how it can be
    wicked to want to give up your special privileges."</p>

    <p>"Where in the world do you pick up ideas like this?"</p>

    <p>"I inherited them from an English ancestor of mine, who gave
    up all that he had when he enlisted in Washington's army."</p>

    <p>"You got that stuff," said Eddie, brushing this aside, "from
    David Moreton, and that infernal seditious paper his brother
    edits&mdash;and that white-livered book which I haven't read
    against war. I'd like to put them all in jail."</p>

    <p>"It's a pity," said Crystal, "that your side can't think of
    a better argument than putting everyone who disagrees with you
    in jail."</p>

    <p>With this she turned and left him, and, entering the
    ballroom, flung herself into the arms of the first partner she
    met. It was a timid boy, who, startled by the eagerness with
    which she chose him, with her bright
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"
       id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>eyes and quickly drawn breath,
       was just coming to the conclusion that a lovely, rich, and
       admired lady, had fallen passionately in love with him, when
       with equal suddenness she stepped out of his arms and was
       presently driving her small, open car down the avenue.</p>

    <p>Under the purple beech Eddie, left alone, sank back on the
    stone bench and considered, somewhat as the persecutors of
    Socrates may have done, suitable punishments for those who put
    vile, revolutionary ideas into the heads of young and lovely
    women.</p>

    <p>In the meantime Ben, who had enjoyed the party more than
    most of the invited guests, and far more than the disconsolate
    Eddie, had left his vantage point at the window. He had
    suddenly become aware of a strange light stealing under the
    trees, and, looking up, he saw with surprise that the stars
    were growing small and the heavens turning steel-color&mdash;in
    fact, that it was dawn.</p>

    <p>Convinced that sunrise was a finer sight than the end of the
    grandest ball that ever was given, he made his way down a
    shabby back lane, and before long came out on the edge of the
    cliffs, with the whole panorama
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"
       id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>of sunrise over the Atlantic
       spread out before him.</p>

    <p>He stood there a moment, somebody's close, well-kept lawn
    under his feet, and a pale-pink sea sucking in and out on the
    rocks a hundred feet below. The same hot, red sun was coming
    up; there wasn't a steady breeze, but cool salt puffs came to
    him now and then with a breaking wave. It was going to be a hot
    day, and Ben liked swimming better than most things in life. He
    hesitated.</p>

    <p>If he had turned to the left, he would have come presently
    to a public beach and would have had his swim conventionally
    and in due time. But some impulse told him to turn to the
    right, and he began to wander westward along the edge of the
    cliffs&mdash;always on his left hand, space and the sea, and on
    his right, lawns or gardens or parapets crowned by cactus
    plants in urns, and behind these a great variety of
    houses&mdash;French chateaux and marble palaces and nice little
    white cottages, and, finally, a frowning Gothic castle. All
    alike seemed asleep, with empty piazzas and closed shutters,
    and the only sign of life he saw in any of them was one pale
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"
       id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>housemaid shaking a duster out
       of a window in an upper gable.</p>

    <p>At last he came to a break in the cliffs&mdash;a cove, with
    a beach in it, a group of buildings obviously bathing-houses.
    The sacredness of this pavilion did not occur to Ben; indeed,
    there was nothing to suggest it. He entered it light-heartedly
    and was discouraged to find the door of every cabin securely
    locked. The place was utterly deserted. But Ben was persistent,
    and presently he detected a bit of a garment hanging over a
    door, and, pulling it out, he found himself in possession of a
    man's bathing suit. A little farther on he discovered a
    telephone room unlocked. Here he undressed and a minute later
    was swimming straight out to sea.</p>

    <p>The level rays of the sun were doing to the water just what
    the headlights of the motors had done to the road; they were
    enlarging every ripple and edging the deep purple-blue with
    yellow light. Except for a fishing dory chunking out to its
    day's work, Ben had the sea and land to himself. He felt as if
    they were all his own, and, for a socialist, was guilty of the
    sin of pride of possession. He was enjoying himself so much
    that it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"
       id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>was a long time before he
       turned to swim back.</p>

    <p>He was swimming with his head under water most of the time
    so that he did not at once notice that a raft he had passed on
    his way out was now occupied. As soon as he did see it his head
    came up. It was a female figure, and even from a distance he
    could see that she was unconscious of his presence and felt
    quite as sure of having the world to herself as he was. She was
    sitting on the edge of the raft, kicking a pair of the
    prettiest legs in the world in and out of the water. They were
    clad in the thinnest of blue-silk stockings, the same in which
    a few minutes before she had been dancing, but not being able
    to find any others in her bathhouse, she had just kept them on,
    recklessly ignoring the inevitable problem of what she should
    wear home. She was leaning back on her straightened arms, with
    her head back, looking up into the sky and softly whistling to
    herself. Ben saw in a second that she was the girl of the
    silver turban.</p>

    <p>He stole nearer and nearer, cutting silently through the
    water, and then, when he had looked his fill, he put his head
    down again, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"
       id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>splashed a little, and did not
       look up until his hand was on the raft, when he allowed an
       expression of calm surprise to appear on his face.</p>

    <p>"I beg your pardon," he said. "Is this a private raft?"</p>

    <p>The young lady, who had had plenty of time since the splash
    to arrange her countenance, looked at him with a blank
    coldness, and then suddenly smiled.</p>

    <p>"I thought it was a private world," she replied.</p>

    <p>"It's certainly a very agreeable one," said Ben, climbing on
    the raft. "And what I like particularly about it is the fact
    that no one is alive but you and me. Newport appears to be a
    city of the dead."</p>

    <p>"It always was," she answered, contemptuously.</p>

    <p>"Oh, come. Not an hour ago you were dancing in blue and
    green and a silver turban at a party over there," and he waved
    his hand in the direction from which he had come.</p>

    <p>"Did you think it was a good ball?"</p>

    <p>"I enjoyed it," he answered, truthfully.</p>

    <p>Her face fell. "How very disappointing," she said. "I didn't
    see you there."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34"
       id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>

    <p>"Disappointing that you did not see me there?"</p>

    <p>"No," she replied, and then, less positively; "No; I meant
    it was disappointing that you were the kind of man who went to
    parties&mdash;and enjoyed them."</p>

    <p>"It would be silly to go if you didn't enjoy them," he
    returned, lightly.</p>

    <p>She turned to him very seriously. "You're right," she said;
    "it is silly&mdash;very silly, and it's just what I do. I
    consider parties like that the lowest, emptiest form of human
    entertainment. They're dull; they're expensive; they keep you
    from doing intelligent things, like studying; they keep you
    from doing simple, healthy things, like sleeping and
    exercising; they make you artificial; they make you civil to
    people you despise&mdash;they make women, at least, for we must
    have partners&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"But why do you go, then?"</p>

    <p>She was silent, and they looked straight and long at each
    other. Then she said, gravely:</p>

    <p>"The answer's very humiliating. I go because I haven't
    anything else to do."</p>

    <p>He did not reassure her. "Yes, that's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"
       id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>bad," he said, after a second.
       "But of course you could not expect to have anything else to
       do when all your time is taken up like that. 'When the half
       gods go,' you know, 'the gods arrive.'"</p>

    <p>The quotation was not new to Crystal; in fact, she had
    quoted it to Eddie not very long before, apropos of another
    girl to whom he had shown a mild attention, but it seemed to
    her as if she took in for the first time its real meaning.
    Whether it was the dawn, exhaustion, a stimulating personality,
    love, or mere accident, the words now came to her with all the
    beauty and truth of a religious conviction. They seemed to
    shake her and make her over. She felt as if she could never be
    sufficiently grateful to the person who had thus made all life
    fresh and new to her.</p>

    <p>"Ah," she said, very gently, "that's it. I see. You won't
    believe me, but I assure you from now on I mean to be entirely
    different."</p>

    <p>"Please, not too different."</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, yes, as different as possible. I've been so
    unhappy, and unhappy about nothing definite&mdash;that's the
    worst kind, only that I have not liked the life I was
    leading."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"
       id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>

    <p>She glanced at him appealingly. She had tried to tell this
    simple story to so many people, for she had many friends, and
    yet no one had ever really understood. Some had told her she
    was spoiled, more, that there was no use in trying to change
    her life because she would soon marry; most of them had advised
    her to marry and find out what real trouble was. Now, as she
    spoke she saw that this strange young man from the sea not only
    understood her discontent, but thought it natural, almost
    commonplace.</p>

    <p>She poured it all out. "Only the worst thing," she ended,
    "is that I'm not really any good. There isn't anything else
    that I know how to do."</p>

    <p>"I doubt that," he answered, and she began to doubt it, too.
    "I'm sure there are lots of things you could do if you put your
    mind on it. Did you ever try to write?"</p>

    <p>Now, indeed, she felt sure that he was gifted with powers
    more than mortal&mdash;to have guessed this secret which no one
    else had ever suspected. She colored deeply.</p>

    <p>"Why, yes," she answered, "I think I can&mdash;a little,
    only I've so little education."</p>

    <p>"So little
    education?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
       id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>

    <p>"Yes, I belong to the cultivated classes&mdash;three
    languages and nothing solid."</p>

    <p>"Well, you know, three languages seem pretty solid to me,"
    said Ben, who had wrestled very unsuccessfully with the French
    tongue. "You speak three languages, and let me see, you know a
    good deal about painting and poetry and jade and Chinese
    porcelains?"</p>

    <p>She shrugged her shoulders contemptuously. "Oh, of course
    everyone knows about those things, but what good are they?"</p>

    <p>They were a good deal of good to Ben. He pressed on toward
    his final goal. "What is your attitude toward fairies?" he
    asked, and Miss Cox would have heard in his tone a faint memory
    of his voice when he engaged a new office-boy.</p>

    <p>Her attitude toward fairies was perfectly satisfactory, and
    he showed so much appreciation that she went on and told him
    her great secret in full. She had once had something published
    and been paid money for it&mdash;fifteen dollars&mdash;and
    probably never in her life had she spoken of any sum with so
    much respect. It had been, well, a sort of a review of a new
    illustrated edition of Hans
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"
       id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>Andersen's Tales, treating
       them as if they were modern stories, commenting on them from
       the point of view of morals and probability&mdash;making fun
       of people who couldn't give themselves up to the charm of a
       story unless it tallied with their own horrid little
       experiences of life. She told it, she said, very badly, but
       perhaps he could get the idea.</p>

    <p>He got it perfectly. "Good," he said. "I'll give you a job.
    I'm a newspaper editor."</p>

    <p>"Oh," she exclaimed, "you're not Mr. Munsey, are you, or Mr.
    Reid, or Mr. Ochs?"</p>

    <p>Her knowledge of newspaper owners seemed to come to a sudden
    end.</p>

    <p>"No," he answered, smiling, "nor even Mr. Hearst. I did not
    say I owned a newspaper. I edit it. I need some one just like
    you for my book page, only you'd have to come to New York and
    work hard, and there wouldn't be very much salary. Can you
    work?"</p>

    <p>"Anyone can."</p>

    <p>"Well, will you?"</p>

    <p>"Indeed I will." (It was a vow.) "And now I must go. I have
    to drive myself home in an open car, and the tourists do stare
    at one so&mdash;in fancy
    dress."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"
       id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>

    <p>"Yes, but when am I to see you again? I leave Newport
    to-night."</p>

    <p>"Telephone me&mdash;2079&mdash;and we'll arrange to do
    something this afternoon."</p>

    <p>"And whom shall I ask for?"</p>

    <p>"Telephone at two-fifteen to the minute, and I'll answer the
    telephone myself."</p>

    <p>She evidently rather enjoyed the mystery of their not
    knowing each other's names. But a black idea occurred to Ben.
    She had slid off the raft and swum a few strokes before he
    shouted to her:</p>

    <p>"Look here. Your name isn't Eugenia, is it?"</p>

    <p>She waved her hand. "No, I'm Crystal," she called back.</p>

    <p>"Good-by, Crystal."</p>

    <p>This time she did not wave, but, swimming on her side with
    long, easy strokes, she gave him a sweet, reassuring look.</p>

    <p>After she had gone he lay down on the raft with his face
    buried in his arms. A few moments before he had thought he
    could never see enough of the sunrise and the sea, but now he
    wanted to shut it out in favor of a much finer spectacle within
    him. So this was love. Strange that no one had ever
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"
       id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>been able to prepare you for
       it. Strange that poets had never been able to give you a
       hint of its stupendous inevitability. He wondered if all
       miracles were like that&mdash;so simple&mdash;so&mdash;</p>

    <p>Suddenly he heard her voice near him. He lifted his head
    from his arms. She was there in the water below him, clinging
    to the raft with one hand.</p>

    <p>"I just came back to tell you something," she said. "I
    thought you ought to know it before things went any
    farther."</p>

    <p>He thought, "Good God! she's in love with some one else!"
    and the horror of the idea made him look at her severely.</p>

    <p>"I'm not perhaps just as I seem&mdash;I mean my views are
    rather liberal. In fact"&mdash;she brought it out with an
    effort&mdash;"I'm almost a socialist."</p>

    <p>The relief was so great that Ben couldn't speak. He bent his
    head and kissed the hand that had tempted him a few hours
    before.</p>

    <p>She did not resent his action. Her special technique in such
    matters was to pretend that such little incidents hardly came
    into the realm of her consciousness. She said,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"
       id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>"At two-fifteen, then," and
       swam away for good.</p>

    <p>Later in the day a gentleman who owned both a bathing house
    and a bathing suit on Bailey's beach was showing the latter
    possession to a group of friends.</p>

    <p>"No one can tell me that Newport isn't damp," he said. "I
    haven't been in bathing for twenty-four hours, and yet I can
    actually wring the water out of my suit."</p>

    <h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

    <p>That same morning, about ten o'clock, Mr. William Cord was
    shut up in the study of his house&mdash;shut up, that is, as
    far as entrance from the rest of the house was concerned, but
    very open as to windows looking out across the grass to the
    sea. It was a small room, and the leather chairs which made up
    most of its furnishings were worn, and the bookshelves were
    filled with volumes like railroad reports and <i>Poor's
    Manual</i>, but somehow the total effect of the room was so
    agreeable that the family used it more than Mr. Cord liked.</p>

    <p>He was an impressive figure, tall, erect, and with that
    suggestion of unbroken health which had had something to do
    with his success in life. His hair must have been of a sandy
    brown, for it had turned, not gray nor white, but that queer
    no-color that sandy hair does turn, melting into all pale
    surroundings. His long face was not vividly colored, either,
    but was stamped with the immobility
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"
       id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>of expression that sensitive
       people in contact with violent life almost always acquire.
       The result was that there seemed to be something dead about
       his face until you saw his eyes, dark and fierce, as if all
       the fire and energy of the man were concentrated in
       them.</p>

    <p>He was dressed in gray golfing-clothes that smelled more of
    peat than peat does, and, though officially supposed to be
    wrestling with the more secret part of correspondence which
    even his own secretary was not allowed to see, he was actually
    wiggling a new golf-club over the rug, and toying with the
    romantic idea that it would enable him to drive farther than he
    had ever driven before.</p>

    <p>There was a knock at the door. Mr. Cord leaned the driver in
    a corner, clasped his hands behind his back, straddled his legs
    a trifle, so that they seemed to grow out of the rug as the
    eternal oak grows out of the sod, and said, "Come in," in the
    tone of a man who, considering the importance of his
    occupation, bears interruption exceedingly well.</p>

    <p>Tomes, the butler, entered. "Mr. Verriman, sir, to see
    you."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"
       id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>

    <p>"To see <i>me</i>?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

    <p>Cord just nodded at this, which evidently meant that the
    visitor was to be admitted, for Tomes never made a mistake and
    Verriman presently entered. Mr. Cord had seen Eddie Verriman
    the night before at the ball, and had thought him a very fine
    figure of a man, so now, putting two and two together, he said
    to himself, "Is he here to ask my blessing?"</p>

    <p>Aloud he said nothing, but just nodded; it was a belief that
    had translated itself into a habit&mdash;to let the other man
    explain first.</p>

    <p>"I know I'm interrupting you, Mr. Cord," Verriman began. Mr.
    Cord made a lateral gesture with his hand, as if all he had
    were at the disposal of his friends, even his most precious
    asset&mdash;time.</p>

    <p>"It's something very important," Eddie went on. "I'm
    worried. I haven't slept. Mr. Cord, have you checked up
    Crystal's economic beliefs lately?"</p>

    <p>"Lately?" said Mr. Cord. "I don't know that I ever have.
    Have a cigar?"</p>

    <p>Eddie waved the cigar aside as if his host
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"
       id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>had offered it to him in the
       midst of a funeral service.</p>

    <p>"Well, I have," he said, as if some one had to do a parent's
    duty, "and I've been very much distressed&mdash;shocked. I had
    a long talk with her about it at the dance last night."</p>

    <p>"About economics?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

    <p>"Why, Eddie, don't I seem to remember your telling me you
    were in love with Crystal?"</p>

    <p>"Yes, Mr. Cord, I am."</p>

    <p>"Then what do you want to talk economics for? Or is it done
    like that nowadays?"</p>

    <p>"I don't want to," answered Eddie, almost in a wail.
    "<i>She</i> does. She gets me going and then we quarrel because
    she has terrible opinions. She talks wildly. I have to point
    out to her that she's wrong. And last night she told
    me"&mdash;Eddie glanced about to be sure he was not
    overheard&mdash;"she told me that she was a socialist."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cord had just lit the very cigar which Eddie had waved
    away, and he took the first critical puffs at it before he
    answered:</p>

    <p>"Did you ask her what that was?"</p>

    <p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I
    didn't."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"
       id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>

    <p>"Missed a trick there, Eddie."</p>

    <p>It was impossible to accuse so masklike a magnate of
    frivolity, but Eddie was often dissatisfied with Mr. Cord's
    reactions to the serious problems of life.</p>

    <p>"But don't you think it's terrible," he went on, eagerly,
    "for Crystal to be a socialist? In this age of the
    world&mdash;civilization trembling on the
    brink&mdash;chaos"&mdash;Eddie made a gesture toward the
    perfectly ordered shelves containing <i>Poor's
    Manual</i>&mdash;"staring us in the face? You say that the
    half-baked opinions of an immature girl make no
    difference?"</p>

    <p>"No, I shouldn't say that&mdash;at least not to Crystal,"
    murmured her father.</p>

    <p>"But the mere fact that she picks up such ideas proves that
    they are in the air about us and that terrifies
    me&mdash;terrifies me," ended Eddie, his voice rising as he saw
    that his host intended to remain perfectly calm.</p>

    <p>"Which terrifies you, Eddie&mdash;Crystal or the
    revolution?"</p>

    <p>"The general discontent&mdash;the fact that civilization is
    tr&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, that," said Mr. Cord, hastily. "Well, I wouldn't
    allow that to terrify me, Eddie. I should have more sympathy
    with <span class="pagenum"><a name="page47"
       id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>you if it had been Crystal.
       Crystal is a good deal of a proposition, I grant you. The
       revolution seems to me simpler. If a majority of our fellow
       countrymen really want it, they are going to get it in spite
       of you and me; and if they don't want it, they won't have it
       no matter how Crystal talks to you at parties. So cheer up,
       Eddie, and have a cigar."</p>

    <p>"They can, they will," said Eddie, not even troubling to
    wave away the cigar this time. "You don't appreciate what an
    organized minority of foreign agitators can do in this country.
    Why, they can&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Well, if a minority of foreigners can put over a revolution
    against the will of the American people, we ought to shut up
    shop, Eddie."</p>

    <p>"You're not afraid?"</p>

    <p>"No."</p>

    <p>"You mean you wouldn't fight it?"</p>

    <p>"You bet your life I'd fight it," said Mr. Cord, gayly, "but
    I fight lots of things without being afraid of them. What's the
    use of being afraid? Here I am sixty-five, conservative and
    trained to only one game, and yet I feel as if <i>I</i> could
    manage to make <span class="pagenum"><a name="page48"
       id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>my own way even under soviet
       rule. Anyway, I don't want to die or emigrate just because
       my country changes its form of government. Only it would
       have to be the wish of the majority, and I don't believe it
       ever will be. In the meantime there is just one thing I
       <i>am</i> afraid of&mdash;and that's the thing that you and
       most of my friends want to do first&mdash;suppressing free
       speech; if you suppress it, we won't know who wants what.
       Then you really do get an explosion."</p>

    <p>Eddie had got Mr. Cord to be serious now, with the
    unfortunate result that the older man was more shocking than
    ever.</p>

    <p>"Free speech doesn't mean treason and sedition," Eddie
    began.</p>

    <p>"It means the other man's opinion."</p>

    <p>There was a pause during which Eddie became more perturbed
    and Mr. Cord settled back to his habitual calm.</p>

    <p>"Wouldn't you suppress <i>anything</i>?" Verriman asked at
    length, willing to know the worst. "Not even such a vile sheet
    as <i>Liberty</i>?"</p>

    <p>"Do you ever see it, Eddie?"</p>

    <p>"Read a rotten paper like that? Certainly not. Do
    you?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
       id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>

    <p>"I subscribe to it." And, bending down, Mr. Cord unlocked a
    drawer in his desk and produced the issue of the preceding
    day.</p>

    <p>"I notice you keep it locked up," said Eddie, and felt that
    he had scored.</p>

    <p>"I have to," replied Mr. Cord, "or else Crystal gets hold of
    it and cuts it all up into extracts&mdash;she must have sent
    you some&mdash;before I get a chance to read it. Besides, it
    shocks Tomes. You ought to talk to Tomes, Eddie. He thinks
    about as you do&mdash;"</p>

    <p>At this moment the door opened and Tomes himself
    entered.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Moreton would like to see you, sir."</p>

    <p>Even Cord's calm was a little disturbed by this unexpected
    news.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Moreton!" he exclaimed.
    "Not&mdash;not&mdash;not&mdash;not?"</p>

    <p>"No, sir," said Tomes, always in possession of accurate
    information. "His brother, I believe."</p>

    <p>"Show him in here," said Cord, and added to Eddie, as Tomes
    left the room: "Well, here he is&mdash;the editor himself,
    Eddie. You can say it all to
    him."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"
       id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>

    <p>"I don't want to see such fellows," Verriman began.</p>

    <p>"Stay and protect me, Eddie. He may have a bomb in his
    pocket."</p>

    <p>"You don't really believe that he's come to&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"No, Eddie, I don't. I think he's come like young
    Lochinvar&mdash;to dance a little late at the wedding. To try
    to persuade me to accept that lazy, good-looking brother of his
    as a son-in-law. He'll have quite a job over that." Then, as
    the door opened, Mr. Cord's eyes concentrated on it and his
    manner became a shade sharper. "Ah, Mr. Moreton, good morning.
    Mr. Verriman&mdash;Mr. Moreton."</p>

    <p>Ben was a good-looking young man, but it was his
    expression&mdash;at once illuminated and determined&mdash;that
    made him unusual. And the effect of his night and morning had
    been to intensify this, so that now, as he stood a moment in
    the doorway, he was a very attractive and compelling
    figure.</p>

    <p>"I came to see my brother, Mr. Cord," he said, simply, "but
    I hear he's not here any more. If I could speak to you alone
    for a few minutes&mdash;" He glanced at Eddie,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"
       id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>whom he instantly recognized
       as the man who had not known how to talk to the woman in the
       world best worth talking to.</p>

    <p>"Oh, you may speak before Mr. Verriman," said Cord. "He
    knows the situation&mdash;knows your brother&mdash;knows my
    children&mdash;knows about you. In fact, we were just speaking
    about your paper when you came in. However, I must tell you
    that Mr. Verriman doesn't approve of <i>Liberty</i>. At least,
    I believe I understood you right, Eddie." And Mr. Cord, having
    thus assured himself a few minutes to regain his poise, leaned
    back comfortably in his chair.</p>

    <p>"What's wrong with the paper, Mr. Verriman?" said Ben,
    pleasantly.</p>

    <p>Eddie did not love the adventure of mental combat, but he
    was no coward. "It seems to me," he said, "that it preaches
    such radical changes in our government that it is seditious. To
    be frank, Mr. Moreton, I think the government ought to suppress
    it."</p>

    <p>"But we don't break the law. The government can't suppress
    us."</p>

    <p>"Then the laws ought to be changed so that it can."</p>

    <p>"That's all we advocate, Mr. Verriman,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"
       id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>the changing of the law. It
       isn't any more seditious for me to say it than for you to,
       is it?"</p>

    <p>Of course in Eddie's opinion it was&mdash;much, much more
    seditious. Only somehow it was a difficult point to make clear,
    if a person was so wrongheaded he couldn't see it for himself.
    The point was that he, Eddie, was right in wanting the laws
    changed and Moreton was wrong. Anyone, it seemed to Eddie,
    would agree to that, unless he happened to agree with Moreton
    beforehand, and those were just the people who ought to be
    deported, imprisoned, or even perhaps in rare instances, as
    examples, strung up to lamp-posts. Only each time he tried to
    put these very natural opinions in words, they kept sounding
    wrong and tyrannical and narrow&mdash;qualities which Eddie
    knew he was entirely without. In order to counteract this
    effect, he tried at first to speak very temperately and calmly,
    but, unhappily, this only had the effect of making him sound
    patronizing to Ben's ears.</p>

    <p>In short, it was hardly to be expected that the discussion
    would be amicable, and it was not. Each man began to be angry
    in his <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
       id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>own way. Eddie shouted a
       little, and Ben expressed himself with turns of phrase quite
       needlessly insulting. Ben found Verriman's assumption that
       the profits of capital were bound up with patriotism, family
       life, and the Christian religion almost as irritating as
       Verriman found Ben's assumption that the government of labor
       as a class would be entirely without the faults that have
       always marked every form of class government.</p>

    <p>"And suppose you got socialism," said Eddie, at last,
    "suppose you did divide everything up equally, don't you
    suppose that in a few years the clever, strong, industrious men
    would have it all in their own hands?"</p>

    <p>"Very likely," said Ben, "but that would be quite a change
    from the present arrangement, wouldn't it?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Cord had a narrow escape from laughing out loud, which
    would have cost him the friendship of the man with whom on the
    whole he really agreed. He thought it was time to
    interfere.</p>

    <p>"This is very interesting, Mr. Moreton," he said, "but I
    fancy it wasn't about the general radical propaganda that you
    came to see me."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"
       id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>

    <p>"No," said Ben, turning slowly. He felt as a dog feels who
    is dragged out of the fight just as it begins to get exciting.
    "No, I came to see you about this unfortunate engagement of my
    brother's."</p>

    <p>"Unfortunate?" asked Mr. Cord, without criticism.</p>

    <p>"I should consider it so, and I understand you do, too."</p>

    <p>Cord did not move an eyelash; this was an absolutely new
    form of attack. It had certainly never crossed his mind that
    any objection could come from the Moreton family.</p>

    <p>"You consider it unfortunate?" said Eddie, as if it would be
    mere insolence on Ben's part to object to his brother's
    marrying anyone.</p>

    <p>"Will you give me your reasons for objecting?" said
    Cord.</p>

    <p>Ben smiled. "You ought to understand them," he said, "for I
    imagine they're pretty much the same as your own. I mean they
    are both founded on class consciousness. I feel that it will be
    destructive to the things I value most in David to be dependent
    on, or associated with, the capitalistic group. Just as you
    feel it will be destructive to your
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"
       id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>daughter to be married to a
       tutor&mdash;a fellow with radical views and a seditious
       brother&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"One moment, one moment," said Cord; "you've got this all
    wrong so far as I'm concerned. I do most emphatically disagree
    with the radical propaganda. I think the radical is usually
    just a man who hasn't got something he wants."</p>

    <p>"And the conservative is a man who wants to keep something
    he's got," said Ben, less hostilely than he had spoken to
    Eddie.</p>

    <p>"Exactly, exactly," said Cord. "In ideality there isn't much
    to choose between them, but, generally speaking, I have more
    respect for the man who has succeeded in getting something to
    preserve than for the man who hasn't got anything to lose."</p>

    <p>"If their opportunities were equal."</p>

    <p>"I say in general. There is not much to choose between the
    two types; but there is in my opinion a shade in favor of the
    conservative on the score of efficiency, and I am old-fashioned
    perhaps, but I like efficiency. If it came to a fight, I should
    fight on the conservative side. But this is all beside the
    point. My objections to your brother, Mr. Moreton, are not
    objections <span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"
       id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>to his group or class. They
       are personal to him. Damned personal."</p>

    <p>"You don't like David?"</p>

    <p>"Why, he's an attractive young fellow, but, if you'll
    forgive my saying so, Mr. Moreton, I don't think he's any good.
    He's weak, he's idle, he entirely lacks that aggressive will
    that&mdash;whether we have your revolution or not&mdash;is the
    only bulwark a woman has in this world. Why, Mr. Moreton, you
    are evidently a very much more advanced and dangerous radical
    than your brother, but I should not have half the objection to
    you that I have to him. There is only one thing that makes a
    difference in this world&mdash;character. Your brother hasn't
    got it."</p>

    <p>For an instant the perfect accuracy of Cord's statements
    about David left Ben silent. Then he pulled himself together
    and said, with a firmness he did not wholly feel:</p>

    <p>"You hardly do David justice. He may not have great force,
    but he has talent, great sweetness, no vices&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Oh, quite, quite, quite, quite," said Cord, with a gesture
    of his long hand that should somehow have recalled to Ben the
    motion of a hand he had recently
    kissed.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"
       id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>

    <p>"However," said Ben, "there is no use in arguing about our
    differences. The point is we are agreed that this marriage
    ought not to be. Let us co-operate on that. Where could I find
    David? I believe if I could see him I'd have some effect on
    him."</p>

    <p>"You mean you could talk him out of marrying the girl he
    loves?"</p>

    <p>"I might make him see the folly of it."</p>

    <p>"Well, I haven't said anything as bad about your brother as
    that, Mr. Moreton. But you do him injustice. You couldn't talk
    him out of it, and if you could, she'd talk him right back into
    it again. But there is one thing to consider. I understand you
    make him an allowance. How about stopping that?"</p>

    <p>"I wouldn't consider that for a moment," said Ben, with more
    temper than he had so far shown. "I don't make him that
    allowance so that I can force him to do what I think best. I
    give it to him because he needs it. I don't believe in force,
    Mr. Cord."</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, you do, Mr. Moreton."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"You were proposing to use a much more pernicious kind of
    force when you proposed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"
       id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>talking the boy out of his
       first love. However, to be candid with you, I must tell you
       that the issue is dead. They ran off yesterday and were
       married in Boston."</p>

    <p>There was a short silence and then Ben moved toward the
    door.</p>

    <p>"Won't you stay to lunch?" said Mr. Cord, politely.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, no," said Ben. He wanted to be alone. Like all
    dominating people who don't get their own way in an altruistic
    issue, his feelings were deeply wounded. He took his hat from
    the disapproving Tomes, and went out to the sea to think. He
    supposed he was going to think about David's future and the
    terrible blow his paper had just received.</p>

    <p>As the door closed behind him, Eddie turned to Mr. Cord with
    a world of reproach in his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Well," he said, "I must say, sir, I think you were
    unnecessarily gentle with that fellow."</p>

    <p>"Seemed to me a fine young fellow," said Mr. Cord.</p>

    <p>"Asking him to lunch," said Eddie.</p>

    <p>"I did that for Crystal," replied Cord,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"
       id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>getting up and slapping his
       pockets&mdash;a gesture which in some subconscious way he
       hoped would make Eddie go home. "She's always so keen to
       meet new people. If she heard that the editor of
       <i>Liberty</i> had been here while she was asleep and that I
       had not tried to keep him for her to
       see&mdash;whew!&mdash;she would make a scene."</p>

    <p>"But she oughtn't to see people like that," protested Eddie,
    as if he were trying to talk sense in a madhouse. "That was
    what I was just explaining to you, Mr. Cord, when&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"So you were, Eddie, so you were," said Mr. Cord. "Stay to
    lunch and tell Crystal. Or, rather," he added, hastily glancing
    at the clock, "come back to lunch in an hour. I have to go now
    and see&mdash;" Mr. Cord hesitated for the fraction of a
    second&mdash;"the gardener. If you don't see gardeners now and
    then and let them scold you about the weather and the Lord's
    arrangement of the seasons, they go mad and beat their wives.
    See you later, Eddie," and Mr. Cord stepped out through the
    French window. It was only great crises like these that led him
    to offer himself up to the attacks of his
    employees.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"
       id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>

    <p>A severe elderly man with a long, flat upper lip and side
    whiskers immediately sprang apparently from the earth and
    approached him. He had exactly the manner of resolute gloom
    that a small boy has when something has gone wrong at school
    and he wants his mother to drag it out of him.</p>

    <p>"Good morning, sir," he said.</p>

    <p>"Morning, McKellar," said Cord, gayly. "Everything's all
    right, I suppose."</p>

    <p>McKellar shook his head. Everything was about as far from
    all right as it well could be. The cook was a violent maniac
    who required peas to be picked so young that they weren't worth
    the picking. Tomes and his footman were a band of malicious
    pirates who took pleasure in cutting for the table the very
    buds which McKellar was cherishing for the horticultural show.
    And as for the season&mdash;McKellar could not remember such a
    devastatingly dry August since he was a lad at home.</p>

    <p>"Why, McKellar, we had rain two days ago."</p>

    <p>"You wouldn't call that little mist rain, sir."</p>

    <p>"And last week a perfect
    downpour."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
       id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>

    <p>"Ah, that's the kind doesn't sink into the soil." Looking up
    critically at the heavens, McKellar expressed his settled
    conviction that in two weeks' time hardly a blade or a shrub
    would be alive in the island at Newport.</p>

    <p>"Well, that will save us all a lot of trouble, McKellar,"
    said Mr. Cord, and presently left his gloomy gardener. He had
    attained his object. When he went back into the house, Eddie
    had gone, and he could go back to his new driver in peace.</p>

    <p>He was not interrupted until ten minutes past one, when
    Crystal came into the room, her eyes shining with exactly the
    same color that, beyond the lawn, the sea was displaying.
    Unlike Eddie, she looked better than in her fancy dress. She
    had on flat tennis shoes, a cotton blouse and a duck skirt, and
    a russet-colored sweater. Miss Cox would have rejected every
    item of her costume except the row of pearls, which just showed
    at her throat.</p>

    <p>She kissed her father rapidly, and said:</p>

    <p>"Good morning, dear. Are you ready for breakfast&mdash;lunch
    I mean?"</p>

    <p>She was a little bit flustered for the reason that it seemed
    to her as if any one would be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"
       id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>able to see that she was an
       entirely different Crystal from the one of the evening
       before, and she was not quite sure what she was going to
       answer when her father said, as she felt certain he must say
       at any moment, "My dear child, what has come over you?"</p>

    <p>He did not say this, however. He held out his golf-club and
    said, "Got a new driver."</p>

    <p>"Yes, yes, dear, very nice," said Crystal. "But I want to
    have lunch punctually, to-day."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cord sighed. Crystal wasn't always very sympathetic.
    "I'm ready," he said, "only Eddie's coming."</p>

    <p>"<i>Eddie!</i>" exclaimed Crystal, drawing her shoulders up,
    as if at the sight of a cobra in her path. "Why is Eddie coming
    to lunch? I did not ask him."</p>

    <p>"No, my dear, I took that liberty," replied her father. "It
    seemed the only way of getting rid of him."</p>

    <p>"Well, I sha'n't wait for him," said Crystal, ringing the
    bell. "I have an engagement at a quarter past two."</p>

    <p>"At the golf club?" asked her father, his eye lighting a
    little. "You might drive me out, you
    know."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"
       id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>

    <p>"No, dear; quite in the other direction&mdash;with a man who
    was at the party last night."</p>

    <p>"You enjoyed the party?"</p>

    <p>"No, not a bit."</p>

    <p>"But you stayed till morning."</p>

    <p>"I stopped and took a swim."</p>

    <p>"You enjoyed that, I suppose?"</p>

    <p>His daughter glanced at him and turned crimson; but she did
    not have to answer, for at that moment Tomes came, in response
    to her ring, and she said:</p>

    <p>"We won't wait lunch for Mr. Verriman, Tomes." Then, as he
    went away, she asked, "And what was Eddie doing here this
    morning, anyhow?"</p>

    <p>"He was scolding me," replied Mr. Cord. "Have you noticed,
    Crystal, what a lot of scolding is going on in the world at
    present? I believe that that is why no one is getting any work
    done&mdash;everyone is so busy scolding everybody else. The
    politicians are scolding, and the newspapers are scolding, and
    most of the fellows I know are scolding. I believe I've got
    hold of a great truth&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"And may I ask what Eddie was scolding about?" asked
    Crystal, no more interested in great truths than most of
    us.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"
       id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>

    <p>"About you."</p>

    <p>Crystal moved her head about as if things had now reached a
    point where it wasn't even worth while to be angry. "About
    me?"</p>

    <p>"It seems you're a socialist, my dear. Eddie asked me how
    long it was since I had taken an inventory of your economic
    beliefs. I could not remember that I ever had, but perhaps you
    will tell them to me now. That is," Mr. Cord added, "if you can
    do it without scolding me&mdash;probably an impossible
    condition to impose nowadays."</p>

    <p>"It's a pity about Eddie," said Crystal, fiercely. "If only
    stupid people would be content to be stupid, instead of trying
    to run the world&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Ah, my dear, it's only stupid people who are under the
    impression that they can. Good morning again, Eddie, we were
    just speaking of you."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cord added the last sentence without the slightest
    change of tone or expression as his guest was ushered in by
    Tomes, who, catching Crystal's eyes for a more important fact
    than Eddie's arrival, murmured that luncheon was served.</p>

    <p>"Well, Eddie," said Crystal, and there
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"
       id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>was a sort of gay vibration in
       her whole figure, and her tone was like a bright banner of
       war, "and so you came round to complain to my father, did
       you?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Cord laid his hand on her shoulder. "Do you think you
    could demolish Eddie just as well at table, my dear?" he said.
    "If so, there's no use in letting the food get cold."</p>

    <p>"Oh, she can do it anywhere," replied Eddie, bitterly, and
    then, striking his habitual note of warning, he went on, "but,
    honestly, Crystal, if you had heard what your father and I
    heard this morning&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I had a visit from David's brother this morning," put in
    Mr. Cord, "the editor of your favorite morning paper."</p>

    <p>"Ben Moreton, here! Oh, <i>father</i>, why didn't you call
    me? Yes, I know," she added, as her father opened his mouth to
    say that she had left most particular instructions that she was
    to be allowed to sleep as late as she could, "I know, but you
    must have known I should have wanted to look David's brother
    over. Has he long hair? Does he wear a soft tie? Did you hate
    him?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"
       id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>

    <p>"Eddie didn't take much of a fancy to him."</p>

    <p>"I should say not. A damned, hollow-eyed fanatic."</p>

    <p>"Is he as good-looking as David, father? What does he look
    like?"</p>

    <p>Mr. Cord hesitated. "Well, a little like my engraving of
    Thomas Jefferson as a young man."</p>

    <p>"He looks as if he might have a bomb in his pocket."</p>

    <p>"Oh, Eddie, do keep quiet, there's a dear, and let father
    give me one of his long, wonderful accounts. Go ahead,
    father."</p>

    <p>"Well," said Mr. Cord, helping himself from a dish that
    Tomes was presenting to him, "as I told you, Eddie had dropped
    in very kindly to scold me about you, when Tomes announced Mr.
    Moreton. Tomes thought he ought to be put straight out of the
    house. Didn't you, Tomes?"</p>

    <p>"No, sir," said Tomes, who was getting used to his employer,
    although he did not encourage this sort of thing, particularly
    before the footmen.</p>

    <p>"Well, Moreton came in and said, very
    simply&mdash;"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"
       id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>

    <p>"Has he good manners, father?"</p>

    <p>"He has no manners at all," roared Eddie.</p>

    <p>"Oh, how nice," said Crystal, of whom it might be asserted
    without flattery that she now understood in perfection the art
    of irritating Eddie.</p>

    <p>"He is very direct and natural," her father continued. "He
    has a lot more punch than your brother-in-law, my dear. In
    fact, I was rather impressed with the young fellow until he and
    Eddie fell to quarreling. Things did not go so well, then."</p>

    <p>"You mean," said Crystal, the gossip rather getting the best
    of the reformer in her, "that he lost his temper horribly?"</p>

    <p>"I should say he did," said Eddie.</p>

    <p>"Well, Eddie, you know you were not perfectly calm,"
    answered Cord. "Let us say that they both lost their tempers,
    which is strange, for as far as I could see they were agreed on
    many essentials. They both believe that one class in the
    community ought to govern the other. They both believe the
    world is in a very bad way; only, according to Eddie, we are
    going to have chaos if capital loses its control of the
    situation; and according to Moreton we are going to have chaos
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page68"
       id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>if labor doesn't get control.
       So, as one or the other seems bound to happen, we ought to
       be able to adjust ourselves to chaos. In fact, Crystal, I
       have been interviewing McKellar about having a chaos cellar
       built in the garden."</p>

    <p>Eddie pushed back his plate; it was empty, but the gesture
    suggested that he could not go on choking down the food of a
    man who joked about such serious matters.</p>

    <p>"I must say, Mr. Cord," he began, "I really must say&mdash;"
    He paused, surprised to find that he really hadn't anything
    that he must say, and Crystal turned to her father:</p>

    <p>"But you haven't told me why he came. To see Eugenia, I
    suppose?"</p>

    <p>"No; he hadn't heard of the marriage. He came to talk to his
    brother."</p>

    <p>"For you must know," put in Eddie, hastily, "that Mr. Ben
    Moreton does not approve of the marriage&mdash;oh, dear, no. He
    would consider such a connection quite beneath his family. He
    disapproves of Eugenia as a sister-in-law."</p>

    <p>"How could any one disapprove of her?" asked her sister,
    hotly.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"
       id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>

    <p>"Jevver hear such nerve?" said Eddie.</p>

    <p>"It's not Eugenia; it's capital Moreton disapproves of," Mr.
    Cord went on, patiently explaining. "You see it never crossed
    our minds that the Moretons might object, but of course they
    do. They regard us as a very degrading connection. Doubtless it
    will hurt Ben Moreton with his readers to be connected with a
    financial pirate like myself, quite as much as it will hurt me
    in the eyes of most of my fellow board members when it becomes
    known that my son-in-law's brother is the editor of
    <i>Liberty</i>."</p>

    <p>"The Moretons disapprove," repeated Crystal, to whom the
    idea was not at all agreeable.</p>

    <p>"Disapprove, nonsense!" said Eddie. "I believe he came to
    blackmail you. To see what he could get out of you if he
    offered to stop the marriage. Well, why not? If these fellows
    believe all the money ought to be taken away from the
    capitalists, why should they care how it's done? I can't see
    much difference between robbing a man, and legislating his
    fortune out of&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Well, I must tell you, father dear," said Crystal, exactly
    as if Eddie had not been <span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"
       id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>speaking, "that I think it was
       horrid of you not to have me called when you must have
       known&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Crystal, you're scolding me," wailed her father. "And most
    unjustly. I did ask him to lunch just for your sake, although I
    saw Eddie was shocked, and I was afraid Tomes would give
    warning. But I did ask him, only he wouldn't stay."</p>

    <p>Crystal rose from the table with her eye on the clock, and
    they began to make their way back to Mr. Cord's study, as she
    asked:</p>

    <p>"Why wouldn't he stay?"</p>

    <p>"I gathered because he didn't want to. Perhaps he was afraid
    he'd have to argue with Eddie about capital and labor all
    through lunch. And of course he did not know that I had another
    beautiful daughter sleeping off the effects of a late party, or
    very likely he would have accepted."</p>

    <p>Very likely he would.</p>

    <p>Just as they entered the study, the telephone rang. Crystal
    sprang to the instrument, brushing away her father's hand,
    which had moved toward it.</p>

    <p>"It's for me, dear," she said, and continued, speaking into
    the mouthpiece: "Yes, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"
       id="page71"></a>[pg 71]</span>it's I." (A pause.) "Where are
       you?... Oh, yes, I know the place. I'll be there in five
       minutes, in a little blue car." She hung up the receiver,
       sprang up, and looked very much surprised to see Eddie and
       her father still there just as before. "Good-by, Eddie," she
       said, "I'm sorry, but I have an engagement. Good-by,
       father."</p>

    <p>"You don't want to run me out to the golf club first?"</p>

    <p>"Not possible, dear. The chauffeur can take you in the big
    car."</p>

    <p>"Yes, but he'll scold me all the way about there not being
    room enough in the garage."</p>

    <p>Crystal was firm. "I'm sorry, but I can't, dear. This is
    important. I may take a job. I'll tell you all about it this
    evening." And she left the room, with a smile that kept getting
    entirely beyond her control.</p>

    <p>"What's this? What's this?" cried Eddie as the door shut. "A
    job. You wouldn't let Crystal take a job, would you, Mr.
    Cord?"</p>

    <p>"I haven't been consulted," said Mr. Cord, taking out his
    new driver again.</p>

    <p>"But didn't you notice how excited she was. I'm sure it's
    decided."</p>

    <p>"Yes, I noticed, Eddie; but it looked to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"
       id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>me more like a man than a job.
       How do you think we'd come out if I gave you a stroke and a
       half a hole?"</p>

    <p>Eddie was too perturbed even to answer.</p>

    <p>In the meantime, Crystal was spinning along Bellevue Avenue,
    forgetting to bow to her friends, and wondering why the car was
    going so badly until, her eye falling on the speedometer, she
    noticed that she was doing a mild thirty-five miles an hour.
    Sooner, therefore, than the law allowed, she reached a small
    park that surrounds a statue of Perry, and there she picked up
    a passenger.</p>

    <p>Ben got in and shut the little door almost before she
    brought the car to a standstill.</p>

    <p>"When you were little," he said, "did you ever imagine
    something wonderful that might happen&mdash;like the door's
    opening and a delegation coming to elect you captain of the
    baseball team, or whatever is a little girl's equivalent of
    that&mdash;and keep on imagining it and imagining it, until it
    seemed as if it really were going to happen? Well, I have been
    standing here saying to myself, Wouldn't it be wonderful if
    Crystal should come in a little blue car and take me to drive?
    And, by Heaven! you'll never believe me, but she actually
    did."</p><a id="image3"

    <p>"Tell me everything you've done since I saw you," she
    answered.</p>

    <p>"I haven't done anything but think about you. Oh yes, I
    have, too. I've reappraised the universe. You see, you've just
    made me a present of a brand-new world, and I've been pretty
    busy, I can tell you, untying the string and unwrapping the
    paper, and bless me, Crystal, it looks like a mighty fine
    present so far."</p>

    <p>"Oh," she said, "I think you talk charmingly." She had
    started to say, "you make love charmingly," but on second
    thoughts decided that the overt statement had better come from
    him. "Dear me," she went on, "we have so much to talk about.
    There's my job. Can't we talk a little about that?"</p>

    <p>They could and did. Their talk consisted largely in his
    telling her how much richer a service she could render his
    paper through having been unconsciously steeped in beauty than
    if she had been merely intellectually instructed&mdash;than if,
    as she more simply put it, she had known something. And as he
    talked, her mind began to expand in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"
       id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>warm atmosphere of his praise
       and to give off its perfume like a flower.</p>

    <p>But the idea of her working with him day after day, helping
    the development of the paper which had grown as dear as a child
    to him, was so desirable that he did not dare to contemplate it
    unless it promised realization.</p>

    <p>"Oh," he broke out, "you won't really do it. Your family
    will object, or something. Probably when I go away to-night, I
    shall never see you again."</p>

    <p>"You are still going away to-night?"</p>

    <p>"I must."</p>

    <p>She looked at him and slowly shook her head, as a mother
    shakes her head at the foolish plans of a child.</p>

    <p>"I thought I was going," he said, weakly.</p>

    <p>"Why?"</p>

    <p>He groaned, but did not answer.</p>

    <p>She thought, "Oh, dear, I wish when men want to be comforted
    they would not make a girl spend so much time and energy
    getting them to say that they do want it." Aloud she said:</p>

    <p>"You must tell me what's the matter."</p>

    <p>"It's a long
    story."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75"
       id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>

    <p>"We have all afternoon."</p>

    <p>"That's it&mdash;we haven't all eternity."</p>

    <p>"Oh, eternity," said Crystal, dismissing it with the Cord
    wave of the hand. "Who wants eternity? 'Since we must die how
    bright the starry track,' you know."</p>

    <p>"No; what is that?"</p>

    <p>"I don't remember."</p>

    <p>"Oh."</p>

    <p>After this meeting of minds they drove for some time in
    silence. Ben was seeing a new aspect of Newport&mdash;bare,
    rugged country, sandy roads, a sudden high rock jutting out
    toward the sea, a rock on which tradition asserts that Bishop
    Berkeley once sat and considered the illusion of matter. They
    stopped at length at the edge of a sandy beach. Crystal parked
    her car neatly with a sharp turn of the wheel, and got out.</p>

    <p>"There's a tea basket," she called over her shoulder.</p>

    <p>Ben's heart bounded at the news&mdash;not that he was
    hungry, but as the hour was now but little past half after two
    a tea basket indicated a prolonged interview. He found it
    tucked away in the back of the car, and followed her. They sat
    down at the edge <span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"
       id="page76"></a>[pg 76]</span>of the foam. He lit a pipe,
       clasped his hands about his knees and stared out to sea; she
       curled her feet backward, grasped an ankle in her hand, and,
       looking at him, said:</p>

    <p>"Now what makes you groan so?"</p>

    <p>"I haven't meant to be dishonest," he said, "but I have been
    obtaining your friendship&mdash;trying to&mdash;under false
    pretenses."</p>

    <p>"Trying to?" said Crystal. "Now isn't it silly to put that
    in."</p>

    <p>He turned and smiled at her. She was really incredibly
    sweet. "But, all the same," he went on, "there is a barrier, a
    real, tangible barrier between us."</p>

    <p>Crystal's heart suffered a chill convulsion at these words.
    "Good gracious!" she thought. "He's entangled with another
    woman&mdash;oh dear!&mdash;<i>marriage</i>"&mdash;But she did
    not interrupt him, and he continued:</p>

    <p>"I let you think that I was one of the men you might have
    known&mdash;that I was asked to your party last night, whereas,
    as a matter of fact, I only watched you&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Crystal's mind, working with its normal rapidity, invented,
    faced, and passed over the fact that he must have been one of
    the musicians. She said
    aloud:</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"
       id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>

    <p>"I think I ought to tell you that I'm not much of a believer
    in barriers&mdash;between sensible people who want
    friendship."</p>

    <p>"Friendship!" exclaimed Ben, as if that were the last thing
    he had come out on a lovely summer afternoon to discuss.</p>

    <p>"There aren't any real barriers any more," Crystal
    continued. "Differences of position, and religion, and all
    those things don't seem to matter now. Romeo and Juliet
    wouldn't have paid any attention to the little family
    disagreement if they had lived to-day."</p>

    <p>"In the case of Romeo and Juliet, if I remember correctly,"
    said Ben, "it was not exactly a question of friendship."</p>

    <p>She colored deeply, but he refused to modify his statement,
    for, after all, it was correct. "But difference of opinion
    <i>is</i> an obstacle," he went on. "I have seen husbands and
    wives parted by differences of opinion in the late war. And as
    far as I'm concerned there's a war on now&mdash;a different
    war, and I came here to try to prevent my brother marrying into
    an enemy influence&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Good Heavens!" cried Crystal. "You
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"
       id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>are Ben Moreton! Why didn't I
       see it sooner? I'm Crystal Cord," and, lifting up her chin,
       she laughed.</p>

    <p>That she could laugh as the gulf opened between them seemed
    to him terrible. He turned his head away.</p>

    <p>She stopped laughing. "You don't think it's amusing?" (He
    shook his head.) "That we're relations-in-law, when we thought
    it was all so unknown and romantic? No wonder I felt at home
    with you, when I've read so many of your letters to
    David&mdash;such nice letters, too&mdash;and I subscribe to
    your paper, and read every word of the editorials. And to think
    that you would not lunch with me to-day, when my father asked
    you."</p>

    <p>"To think that it was you I was being asked to lunch with,
    and didn't know it!"</p>

    <p>"Well, you dine with us to-morrow," she answered, stating a
    simple fact.</p>

    <p>"Crystal," he said, and put his hand on hers as if this
    would help him through his long explanation; but the continuity
    of his thought was destroyed and his spirit wounded by her
    immediately withdrawing it; and then&mdash;so exactly does the
    spring of love <span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"
       id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>resemble the uncertain glory
       of an April day&mdash;he was rendered perfectly happy again
       by perceiving that her action was due to the publicity of
       their position and not to repugnance to the caress.</p>

    <p>Fortunately he was a man not without invention, and so when
    a few minutes later she suggested opening the tea basket, he
    insisted on moving to a more retired spot on the plea that the
    teakettle would burn better out of the wind; and Crystal, who
    must have known that Tomes never gave her a teakettle, but made
    the tea at home and put it in a thermos bottle, at once agreed
    to the suggestion.</p>

    <p>They moved back across the road, where irregular rocks
    sheltered small plots of grass and wild flowers, and here,
    instead of an Arcadian duet, they had, most unsuitably, their
    first quarrel.</p>

    <p>It began as quarrels are so apt to do, by a complete
    agreement. Of course he would stay over the next day, which was
    Sunday, and not very busy in the office of <i>Liberty</i>. In
    return he expected her undivided attention. She at once
    admitted that this was part of the plan&mdash;only there would
    have to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"
       id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>be one little exception; she
       was dining out this evening. Oh, well, that could be broken,
       couldn't it? She would like to break it, but it happened to
       be one of those engagements that had to be kept. Ben could
       not understand that.</p>

    <p>At first she tried to explain it to him: She had chosen her
    own evening several weeks ago with these people, who wanted her
    to meet a friend of theirs who was motoring down specially from
    Boston. She felt she must keep her word.</p>

    <p>"I assure you I don't want to, but you understand, don't
    you?"</p>

    <p>If she had looked at his face she would not have asked the
    last question. He did not understand; indeed, he had resolved
    not to.</p>

    <p>"No," he said, "I must own, I don't. If you told me that you
    <i>wanted</i> to go, that would be one thing. I shouldn't have
    a word to say then."</p>

    <p>"Oh yes, you would, Ben," said Crystal, but he did not
    notice her.</p>

    <p>"I can't understand your allowing yourself to be dragged
    there against your will. You say you despise this life, but you
    seem <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"
       id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>to take it pretty seriously if
       you can't break any engagement that you may make."</p>

    <p>"How absurd you are! Of course I often break
    engagements."</p>

    <p>"I see. You do when the inducement is sufficient. Well, that
    makes it all perfectly clear."</p>

    <p>She felt both angry and inclined to cry. She knew that to
    yield to either impulse would instantly solve the problem and
    bring a very unreasonable young man to reason. She ran over
    both scenes in her imagination. Registering anger, she would
    rise and say that, really, Mr. Moreton, if he would not listen
    to her explanation there was no use in prolonging the
    discussion. That would be the critical moment. He would take
    her in his arms then and there, or else he would let her go,
    and they would drive in silence, and part at the little park,
    where of course she might say, "Aren't you silly to leave me
    like this?"&mdash;only her experience was that it was never
    very practical to make up with an angry man in public.</p>

    <p>To burst into tears was a safer method, but she had a
    natural repugnance to crying, and perhaps she was
    subconsciously aware <span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"
       id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>that she might be left, after
       the quarrel was apparently made up by this method, with a
       slight resentment against the man who had forced her to
       adopt so illogical a line of conduct.</p>

    <p>A middle course appealed to her. She laid her hand on Ben's.
    A few minutes before it would have seemed unbelievable to Ben
    that his own hand would have remained cold and lifeless under
    that touch, but such was now the case.</p>

    <p>"Ben," she said, "if you go on being disagreeable a second
    longer you must make up your mind how you will behave when I
    burst into tears."</p>

    <p>"How I should behave?"</p>

    <p>She nodded.</p>

    <p>His hands clasped hers. He told her how he should behave. He
    even offered to show her, without putting her to the trouble of
    tears.</p>

    <p>"You mean," she said, "that you would forgive me? Well,
    forgive me, anyhow. I'm doing what I think is right about this
    old dinner. Perhaps I'm wrong about it; perhaps you're mistaken
    and I'm not absolutely perfect, but if I were, think what a lot
    of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"
       id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>fun you would miss in changing
       me. And you know I never meant to abandon you for the whole
       evening. I'll get away at half past nine and we'll take a
       little turn."</p>

    <p>So that was settled.</p>
    <hr class="full" />
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"
       id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>

    <h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

    <p>As they drove back she revealed another plan to
    him&mdash;she was taking him for a moment to see a friend of
    hers. He protested. He did not want to see anyone but herself,
    but Crystal was firm. He must see this woman; she was their
    celebrated parlor Bolshevist. Ben hated parlor Bolshevists. Did
    he know any? No. Well, then. Anyhow, Sophia would never forgive
    her if she did not bring him. Sophia adored celebrities. Sophia
    who? Sophia Dawson. The name seemed dimly familiar to Ben, and
    then he remembered. It was the name on the thousand-dollar
    check for the strike sufferers that had come in the day
    before.</p>

    <p>They drove up an avenue of little oaks to a formidable
    palace built of gray stone, so smoothly faced that there was
    not a crevice in the immense pale fa&ccedil;ade. Two men in
    knee-breeches opened the double doors and they went in between
    golden grilles and rows of tall white lilies. They were led
    through <span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"
       id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>a soundless hall, and up
       stairs so thickly carpeted that the feet sank in as in
       new-fallen snow, and finally they were ushered through a
       small painted door into a small painted room, which had been
       brought all the way from Sienna, and there they found Mrs.
       Dawson&mdash;a beautiful, worn, world-weary Mrs. Dawson,
       with one streak of gray in the front of her dark hair, her
       tragic eyes, and her long violet and black draperies&mdash;a
       perfect Sibyl.</p>

    <p>Crystal did not treat her as a Sibyl, however. "Hullo,
    Sophie!" she said. "This is my brother-in-law's brother, Ben
    Moreton. He's crazy to meet you. You'll like him. I can't stay
    because I'm dining somewhere or other, but he's not."</p>

    <p>"Will he dine with me?" said Mrs. Dawson in a wonderful
    deep, slow voice&mdash;"just stay on and dine with me
    alone?"</p>

    <p>Ben began to say that he couldn't, but Crystal said yes,
    that he would be delighted to, and that she would stop for him
    again about half past nine, and that it was a wonderful plan,
    and then she went away.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Dawson seemed to take it all as a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"
       id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>matter of course. "Sit down,
       Mr. Moreton," she said. "I have a quarrel with you."</p>

    <p>Ben could not help feeling a little disturbed by the way he
    had been injected into Mrs. Dawson's evening without her
    volition. He did not sit down.</p>

    <p>"You know," he said, "there isn't any reason why you should
    have me to dine just because Crystal says so. I do want to
    thank you for the check you sent in to us for the strike fund.
    It will do a lot of good."</p>

    <p>"Oh, that," replied Mrs. Dawson. "They are fighting all our
    battles for us."</p>

    <p>"It cheered us up in the office. I wanted to tell you, and
    now I think I'll go. I dare say you are dining out,
    anyhow&mdash;"</p>

    <p>Her eyes flashed at him. "Dining out!" she exclaimed, as if
    the suggestion insulted her. "You evidently don't know me. I
    never dine out. I have nothing in common with these people. I
    lead a very lonely life. You do me a favor by staying. You and
    I could exchange ideas. There is no one in Newport whom I can
    talk to&mdash;reactionaries."</p>

    <p>"Miss Cord is not exactly a reactionary," said Ben, sitting
    down.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Dawson smiled. "Crystal is not a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"
       id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>reactionary; Crystal is a
       child," she replied. "But what can you expect of William
       Cord's daughter? He is a dangerous and disintegrating
       force&mdash;cold&mdash;cynical&mdash;he feels not the
       slightest public responsibility for his possessions." Mrs.
       Dawson laid her hand on her heart as if it were weighted
       with all her jewels and footmen and palaces. "Most Bourbons
       are cynical about human life, but he goes farther; he is
       cynical about his own wealth. And that brings me to my
       quarrel with you, Mr. Moreton. How could you let your
       brother spend his beautiful vigorous youth as a parasite to
       Cord's vapid son? Was that consistent with your
       beliefs?"</p>

    <p>This attack on his consistency from a lady whose consistency
    seemed even more flagrant amused Ben, but as he listened he was
    obliged to admit that there was a great deal of good sense in
    what she had to say about David, whom she had met once or twice
    at the Cords'. Ben was too candid and eager not to ask her
    before long the question that was in his mind&mdash;how it was
    possible for a woman holding her views to be leading a life so
    opposed to them.</p>

    <p>She was not at all offended, and even less
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88"
       id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>at a loss for an answer. "I am
       not a free agent, Mr. Moreton," she said. "Unhappily, before
       I began to think at all, I had undertaken certain
       obligations. The law allows a woman to dispose of everything
       but her property while she is still a child. I married at
       eighteen."</p>

    <p>It was a story not without interest and Mrs. Dawson told it
    well. There does not live a man who would not have been
    interested.</p>

    <p>They dined, not in the great dining room downstairs, nor
    even in the painted room from Sienna, but in a sort of loggia
    that opened from it, where, beyond the shaded lights, Ben could
    watch the moon rise out of the sea.</p>

    <p>It was a perfect little meal, short, delicious, and quickly
    served by three servants. He enjoyed it thoroughly, although he
    found his hostess a strangely confusing companion. He would
    make up his mind that she was a sincere soul captured by her
    environment, when a freshly discovered jewel on her long
    fingers would shake his faith. And he would just decide that
    she was a melodramatic fraud, when she would surprise him by
    her <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"
       id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>scholarly knowledge of social
       problems. She had read deeply, knew several languages, and
       had known many of the European leaders. Such phrases as
       "Jaur&egrave;s wrote me ten days before he died&mdash;" were
       frequent, but not too frequent, on her lips.</p>

    <p>By the time Crystal stopped for him Ben had begun to feel
    like a child who has lost his mother in a museum, or as Dante
    might have felt if he had missed Virgil from his side. When he
    bade Mrs. Dawson good night, she asked him to come back.</p>

    <p>"Come and spend September here," she said, as if it were a
    small thing. "You can work all day if you like. I sha'n't
    disturb you, and you need never see a soul. It will do you
    good."</p>

    <p>He was touched by the invitation, but of course he refused
    it. He tried to explain tactfully, but clearly, why it was that
    he couldn't do that sort of thing&mdash;that the editor of
    <i>Liberty</i> did not take his holiday at Newport.</p>

    <p>She understood, and sighed. "Ah, yes," she said. "I'm like
    that man in mythology whom neither the sky nor the earth would
    receive. I'm very lonely, Mr.
    Moreton."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"
       id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>

    <p>He found himself feeling sorry for her, as he followed a
    footman downstairs, his feet sinking into the carpets at each
    step. Crystal in the blue car was at the door. She was
    bareheaded and the wind had been blowing her hair about.</p>

    <p>"Well," she said, as he got in, "did you have a good time?
    I'm sure you had a good dinner."</p>

    <p>"Excellent, but confusing. I don't quite get your
    friend."</p>

    <p>"You don't understand Sophia?" Crystal's tone expressed
    surprise. "You mean her jewels and her footmen? Why, Ben, it's
    just like the fathers of this country who talked about all men
    being equal and yet were themselves slaveholders. She sincerely
    believes those things in a way, and then it's such a splendid
    role to play, and she enjoys that; and then it teases Freddie
    Dawson. Freddie is rather sweet if he's thoroughly unhappy, and
    this keeps him unhappy almost all the time. Did she ask you to
    stay? I meant her to."</p>

    <p>"Yes, she did; but of course I couldn't."</p>

    <p>"Oh, Ben, why not?"</p>

    <p>This brought them once more to the discussion
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"
       id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>of the barrier. This time Ben
       felt he could make her see. He said that she must look at it
       this way&mdash;that in a war you could not go and stay in
       enemy country, however friendly your personal relations
       might be. Well, as far as he was concerned this was a war, a
       class war.</p>

    <p>They were headed for the Ocean Drive, and Crystal rounded a
    sharp turn before she answered seriously:</p>

    <p>"But I thought you didn't believe in war."</p>

    <p>"I don't," he answered. "I hate it&mdash;I hate all
    violence. We&mdash;labor, I mean&mdash;didn't initiate this,
    but when men won't see, when they have power and won't stop
    abusing it, there is only one way to make&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Why, Ben," said Crystal, "you're just a pacifist in other
    people's quarrels, but as militaristic as can be in your own.
    I'm not a pacifist, but I'm a better one than you, because I
    don't believe in emphasizing any difference between human
    beings. That's why I want a League of Nations. I hate
    gangs&mdash;all women really do. Little girls don't form gangs
    like little boys. Every settlement worker knows that. I won't
    have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
       id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>you say that I belong to the
       other group. I won't be classified. I'm a human
       being&mdash;and I intend to behave as such."</p>

    <p>Since she had left him she had been immersed again in her
    old life&mdash;her old friends&mdash;and the result had been to
    make her wonder if her experience with Ben had been as
    wonderful as it had seemed. When she stopped for him she had
    been almost prepared to find that the wild joy of their
    meetings had been something accidental and temporary, and that
    only a stimulating and pleasant friendship was left. But as
    soon as she saw that he really regarded their differences
    seriously, all her own prudence and doubt melted away. She knew
    she was ready to make any sacrifices for him, and in view of
    that all talk of obstacles was folly.</p>

    <p>She stopped the car on the point of the island, with the
    open sea on one hand, the harbor on the other. In front of them
    the lightship was moving with a slow, majestic roll, and to the
    right was the long festoon of Narragansett lights, and as they
    stopped the lighted bulk of the New York boat appeared, making
    its way toward Point
    Judith.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"
       id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>

    <p>His prolonged silence began to frighten her.</p>

    <p>"Ben," she said, "do you seriously mean that you believe
    friendship between us is impossible?"</p>

    <p>"Friendship, nothing," answered Moreton. "I love you."</p>

    <p>He said it as if it had always been understood between them,
    as of course it had, but the instant he said it, he gave her a
    quick, appealing look to see how she would take so startling an
    assertion.</p>

    <p>If Crystal had poured out just what was in her mind at that
    second she would have answered: "Of course you do. I've known
    that longer than you have. And can't you see that if I had had
    any doubt about its being true, I'd have taken steps to make it
    true? But, as I really did not doubt it, I've been able to be
    quite passive and leave it mostly to you, which I so much
    prefer."</p>

    <p>But rigorous candor is rarely attained, and Crystal did not
    say this. In fact, for a few seconds she did not say anything,
    but merely allowed her eyes to shine upon him, with the
    inevitable result that at the end of precisely six seconds of
    their benevolent <span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"
       id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>invitation he took her in his
       arms and kissed her. It was a very unprotected point, and
       several cars were standing not too far away, but Crystal,
       who had an excellent sense of proportion, made no objection
       whatever. She was being proved right in two important
       particulars&mdash;first, that she was a human being, and
       second, that there was no barrier between them. She was very
       generous about it. She did not say, "Where's your barrier
       now?" or anything like that; she simply said nothing, and
       the barrier passed out of the conversation and was no more
       seen.</p>

    <p>Very soon, alleging that she must get home at the time at
    which she usually did get home from dinners, she took him back;
    but she soothed him with the promise of an uninterrupted day to
    follow.</p>

    <p>Time&mdash;the mere knowledge of unbroken hours
    ahead&mdash;is a boon which real love cannot do without. Minor
    feelings may flourish on snatched interviews and stolen
    meetings, but love demands&mdash;and usually
    gets&mdash;protected leisure. The next day these lovers had it.
    They spent the morning, when Mr. Cord was known to be playing
    golf, at the Cords' house, and then when Mr. Cord telephoned
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"
       id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>that he was staying to
       luncheon at the club, if Crystal did not object (and Crystal
       did not), she and Ben arranged a picnic&mdash;at least Tomes
       did, and they went off about one o'clock in the blue car.
       They went to a pool in the rocks that Crystal had always
       known about, with high walls around it, and here, with a
       curtain of foam between them and the sea, for the waves were
       rising, they ate lunch, as much alone as on a desert
       island.</p>

    <p>It was here that Ben asked her to marry him, or, to be
    accurate, it was here that they first began talking about their
    life together, and whether Nora would become reconciled to
    another woman about the flat.</p>

    <p>The nearest approach to a definite proposal was Ben's
    saying:</p>

    <p>"You would not mind my saying something about all this to
    your father before I go this evening, would you?"</p>

    <p>And Crystal replied: "Poor father! It will be a blow, I'm
    afraid."</p>

    <p>"Well," said Ben, "he told me himself that he liked me
    better than David."</p>

    <p>"That's not saying much."</p>

    <p>At this Ben laughed
    lightly.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"
       id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>

    <p>He might have had his wrong-headed notions about barriers,
    but he was not so un-American as to regard a father as an
    obstacle.</p>

    <p>"But, oh, Crystal," he added, "suppose you find you do hate
    being poor. It is a bore in some ways."</p>

    <p>Crystal, who had been tucking away the complicated dishes of
    her luncheon basket, looked at Ben and lightly sucked one
    finger to which some raspberry jam from Tomes's supernal
    sandwiches had adhered.</p>

    <p>"I sha'n't mind it a bit, Ben," she said, "and for a good
    reason&mdash;because I'm terribly conceited." He did not
    understand at all, and she went on: "I believe I shall be just
    as much of a person&mdash;perhaps more&mdash;without money. The
    women who really mind being poor are the humble-minded ones,
    who think that they are made by their clothes and their lovely
    houses and their maids and their sables. When they lose them
    they lose all their personality, and of course that terrifies
    them. I don't think I shall lose mine. Does it shock you to
    know that I think such a lot of myself?"</p>

    <p>It appeared it did not shock him at all.</p><a id="image4"

    <p>When they reached the house she established him in the
    drawing-room and went off to find her father.</p>

    <p>She was a true woman, by which is meant now and always that
    she preferred to allow a man to digest his dinner before she
    tried to bring him to a rational opinion. But in this case her
    hands were tied. The Cords dined at eight&mdash;or sometimes a
    little later, and Ben's boat left for New York at half past
    nine, so that it would be utterly impossible to postpone the
    discussion of her future until after dinner. It had to be done
    at once.</p>

    <p>Crystal ran up and knocked at his bedroom door. Loud
    splashings from the adjoining bathroom were all the answer she
    got. She sat down on the stairs and waited. Those are the
    moments that try men's and even women's souls. For the first
    time her enterprise seemed to her a little reckless. For an
    instant she had the surprising experience of recognizing the
    fact that Ben was a total stranger. She looked at the
    gray-stone stairway on which she was sitting and thought that
    her life had been as safe and sheltered as a cloister, and now,
    steered by this total stranger, she proposed to launch herself
    on <span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"
       id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>an uncharted course of change.
       And to this program she was to bring her father's
       consent&mdash;for she knew very well that if she couldn't,
       Ben wouldn't be able to&mdash;in the comparatively short
       time between now and dinner. Then, the splashing having
       ceased, the sound of bureau drawers succeeded, and Crystal
       sprang up and knocked again.</p>

    <p>"That you, Peters?" said an unencouraging voice. (Peters was
    Mr. Cord's valet.)</p>

    <p>"No, dear, it's I," said Crystal.</p>

    <p>"Oh, come in," said Mr. Cord. He was standing in the middle
    of the room in his shirt sleeves and gloomily contemplating the
    shirt he wore. "What's this laundress, anyhow? A Bolshevist or
    a pastry-cook?" he said. "Did you ever see anything like this
    shirt?"</p>

    <p>Crystal approached and studied the shirt. It appeared to her
    to be perfectly done up, but she said: "Yes, dear, how
    terrible! I'll pack her off to-morrow, but you always look all
    right whatever you wear; that's some comfort." She saw that
    even this hadn't done much good, and, going to the heart of the
    problem, she asked, "How did your golf
    go?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
       id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>

    <p>Mr. Cord's gloom gathered as he answered, with resignation,
    "Oh, all right."</p>

    <p>His manner was exactly similar to Ben's in his recent moment
    of depression, and not unlike McKellar's when he had explained
    what he suffered under the good Lord's weather.</p>

    <p>"Is Eddie's game any better?" asked Crystal, feeling her
    way.</p>

    <p>"No," cried her father, contemptuously. "He's rotten, but
    I'm worse. And golf-clubs, Crystal! No one can make a club any
    more. Have you noticed that? But the truth of the matter is,
    I'm getting too old to play golf." And Mr. Cord sat down with a
    good but unconscious imitation of a broken old man.</p>

    <p>Of course Crystal swept this away. She scolded him a little,
    pointed out his recent prowess, and spoke slightingly of all
    younger athletes, but she really had not time to do the job
    thoroughly, for the thought of Ben, sitting so anxious in the
    drawing-room alone, hurried her on.</p>

    <p>"Anyhow, dear," she said, "I've come to talk to you about
    something terribly important. What would you say, father, if I
    told you I was
    engaged?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"
       id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>

    <p>Mr. Cord was so startled that he said, what was rare for
    him, the first thing that came into his head:</p>

    <p>"Not to Eddie?"</p>

    <p>The true diplomatist, we have been told, simply takes
    advantage of chance, and Crystal was diplomatic. "And suppose
    it is?" she replied.</p>

    <p>"I should refuse my consent," replied her father.</p>

    <p>Crystal looked hurt. "Is there anything against Eddie," she
    asked, "except his golf?"</p>

    <p>"Yes," answered her father, "there are two of the most
    serious things in the world against him&mdash;first, that he
    doesn't amount to anything; and second, that you don't love
    him."</p>

    <p>"No," Crystal admitted, "I don't, but
    then&mdash;love&mdash;father, isn't love rather a serious
    undertaking nowadays? Is it a particularly helpful adjunct to
    marriage? Look at poor Eugenia. Isn't it really more sensible
    to marry a nice man who can support one, and then if in time
    one does fall in love with another man&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Never let me hear you talk like that again, Crystal," said
    her father, with a severity and vigor he seldom showed outside
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"
       id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>of board meetings. "It's
       only your ignorance of life that saves you from being
       actually revolting. I'm an old man and not sentimental,
       you'll grant, but, take my word for it, love is the only
       hope of pulling off marriage successfully, and even then
       it's not easy. As for Eugenia, I think she's made a fool of
       herself and is going to be unhappy, but I'd rather do what
       she has done than what you're contemplating. At least she
       cared for that fellow&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I'm glad you feel like that, darling," said Crystal,
    "because it isn't Eddie I'm engaged to, but Ben Moreton. He's
    waiting downstairs now."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cord started up&mdash;his eyes shining like black
    flames.</p>

    <p>"By God! Crystal," he said, "you sha'n't marry that
    fellow&mdash;Eugenia&mdash;perhaps&mdash;but not you."</p>

    <p>"But, father, you said yourself, you thought he was a
    fine&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"I don't care what I said," replied Mr. Cord, and, striding
    to the door, he flung it open and called in a voice that rolled
    about the stone hall: "Mr. Moreton, Mr. Moreton! Come up here,
    will you?"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"
       id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>

    <p>Ben came bounding up the stairs like a panther. Cord
    beckoned him in with a sharp gesture and shut the door.</p>

    <p>"This won't do at all, Moreton," he said. "You can't have
    Crystal."</p>

    <p>Ben did not answer; he looked very steadily at Cord, who
    went on:</p>

    <p>"You think I can't stop it&mdash;that she's of age and that
    you wouldn't take a penny of my money, anyhow. That's the idea,
    isn't it?"</p>

    <p>"That's it," said Ben.</p>

    <p>Cord turned sharply to Crystal. "Does what I think make any
    difference to you?" he asked.</p>

    <p>"A lot, dear," she answered, "but I don't understand. You
    never seemed so much opposed to the radical doctrine."</p>

    <p>"No, it's the radical, not the doctrine, your father objects
    to," said Ben.</p>

    <p>"Exactly," answered Mr. Cord. "You've put it in a nutshell.
    Crystal, I'm going to tell you what these radicals really
    are&mdash;they're failures&mdash;everyone of them. Sincere
    enough&mdash;they want the world changed because they haven't
    been able to get along in it as it is&mdash;they want a new
    deal because <span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"
       id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>they don't know how to play
       their cards; and when they get a new hand, they'll play it
       just as badly. It's not their theories I object to, but them
       themselves. You think if you married Moreton you'd be going
       into a great new world of idealism. You wouldn't. You'd be
       going into a world of failure&mdash;of the pettiest, most
       futile quarrels in the world. The chief characteristic of
       the man who fails is that he always believes it's the other
       fellow's fault; and they hate the man who differs with them
       by one per cent more than they hate the man who differs by
       one hundred. Has there ever been a revolution where they did
       not persecute their fellow revolutionists worse than they
       persecuted the old order, or where the new rule wasn't more
       tyrannical than the old?"</p>

    <p>"No one would dispute that," said Ben. "It is the only way
    to win through to&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Ah," said Cord, "I know what you're going to say, but I
    tell you, you win through to liberal practices when, and only
    when, the conservatives become converted to your ideas, and put
    them through for you. That's why I say I have no quarrel with
    radical doctrines&mdash;they are coming, always coming,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"
       id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>but"&mdash;Cord paused to
       give his words full weight&mdash;"I hate the radical."</p>

    <p>There was a little pause. Crystal, who had sunk into a low
    chair, raised her eyes to Ben, as if she expected a passionate
    contradiction from him, but it did not come.</p>

    <p>"Yes," he said, after a moment, "that's all true, Mr.
    Cord&mdash;with limitations; but, granting it, you've put my
    side, too. What are we to say of the conservative&mdash;the man
    who has no vision of his own&mdash;who has to go about stealing
    his beliefs from the other side? He's very efficient at putting
    <i>them</i> into effect&mdash;but efficient as a tool, as a
    servant. Look at the mess he makes of his own game when he
    tries to act on his own ideas. He crushes democracy with an
    iron efficiency, and he creates communism. He closes the door
    to trade-unionism and makes a revolution. That's efficiency for
    you. We radicals are not so damned inefficient, while we let
    the conservatives do our work for us."</p>

    <p>"Well, let it be revolution, then," said Cord. "I believe
    you're right. It's coming, but do you want to drag a girl like
    Crystal into it? Think of her! Say you take her, as I suppose a
    young fellow like you can do.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"
       id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>She'd have perhaps ten years
       of an exciting division of allegiance between your ideas and
       the way she had been brought up, and the rest of her life
       (for, believe me, as we get older we all return to our early
       traditions)&mdash;the rest of her life she'd spend
       regretting the ties and environment of her youth. On the
       other hand, if she gives you up she will have regrets, too,
       I know, but they won't wreck her and embitter her the way
       the others will."</p>

    <p>Ben's face darkened. No man not a colossal egotist could
    hear such a prophesy with indifference. He did not at once
    answer, and then he turned to Crystal.</p>

    <p>"What do you think of that?" he asked.</p>

    <p>To the surprise of both men, Crystal replied with a laugh.
    "I was wondering," she said, "when either of you would get
    round to asking what I thought of it all."</p>

    <p>"Well, what do you think?" said Cord, almost harshly.</p>

    <p>Crystal rose, and, slipping her arm through his, leaned her
    head on the point of her father's shoulder&mdash;he was of a
    good height. "I think," she said, "you both talk beautifully. I
    was so proud of you both&mdash;saying
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"
       id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>such profound things so
       easily, and keeping your tempers so perfectly" (both brows
       smoothed out), "and it was all the more wonderful because,
       it seemed to me, you were both talking about things you knew
       nothing about."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" burst from both men with simultaneous
    astonishment.</p>

    <p>"Ben, dear, father doesn't know any radicals&mdash;except
    you, and he's only seen you twice. Father dear, I don't believe
    Ben ever talked five minutes with an able, successful
    conservative until he came here to-day."</p>

    <p>"You're going to throw me over, Crystal?" said Ben, seeing
    her pose more clearly than he heard her words.</p>

    <p>"No," said Mr. Cord, bitterly, "she's going to throw over an
    old man in favor of a young one."</p>

    <p>"You silly creatures," said Crystal, with a smile that made
    the words affectionate and not rude. "How can I ever throw
    either of you over? I'm going to be Ben's wife, and I am my
    father's daughter. I'm going to be those two things for all my
    life."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"
       id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>

    <p>Ben took her hand. She puzzled him, but he adored her. "But
    some day, Crystal," he said, "you will be obliged to choose
    between our views&mdash;mine or your father's. You must see
    that."</p>

    <p>"He's right," her father chimed in. "This is not a temporary
    difference of opinion, you know, Crystal. This cleavage is as
    old as mankind&mdash;the radical against the conservative. Time
    doesn't reconcile them."</p>

    <p>Again the idea came to her: "They do love to form gangs, the
    poor dears." Aloud she said: "Yes, but the two types are rarely
    pure ones. Why, father, you think Ben is a radical, but he's
    the most hidebound conservative about some things&mdash;much
    worse than you&mdash;about free verse, for instance. I read a
    long editorial about it not a month ago. He really thinks
    anyone who defends it ought to be deported to some poetic
    limbo. Ben, you think my father is conservative. But there's a
    great scandal in his mental life. He's a Baconian&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"He thinks Bacon wrote the plays!" exclaimed Ben, really
    shocked.</p>

    <p>"Certainly I do," answered Mr. Cord. "Every man who uses his
    mind must think <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
       id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>so. There is nothing in
       favor of the Shakespeare theory, except
       tradition&mdash;"</p>

    <p>He would have talked for several hours upon the subject, but
    Crystal interrupted him by turning to Ben and continuing what
    she had meant to say:</p>

    <p>"When you said I should have to choose between your ideas,
    you meant between your political ideas. Perhaps I shall, but I
    won't make my choice, rest assured, until I have some reason
    for believing that each of you knows something&mdash;honestly
    knows something about the other one's point of view."</p>

    <p>"I don't get it, exactly," said Ben.</p>

    <p>She addressed Mr. Cord.</p>

    <p>"Father," she went on, "Ben has a little flat in Charles
    Street, and an old servant, and that's where I'm going to
    live."</p>

    <p>Her father, though bitterly wounded, had regained his
    sardonic calm. "Perhaps," he said, "you'll bring him up to
    Seventy-ninth Street for Sunday dinner now and then."</p>

    <p>Crystal shook her head. "No, dear," she said. "That isn't
    the way it's going to be. As soon as I get settled and have
    time to look about me, I shall take another little flat for
    you. You will live with us, for a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"
       id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>few months in the winter,
       and get to know Ben's friends&mdash;his gang, as you would
       say&mdash;get to know them not as a philanthropist, or an
       employer, or an observer, but just as one of our
       friends&mdash;see if they really are the way you think they
       are. And then, in March you shall go off to Palm Beach or
       Virginia just as usual."</p>

    <p>"That's a fine idea," said Mr. Cord, sarcastically. "Do you
    realize that I shall hardly survive your marriage with the
    editor of <i>Liberty</i>. I shall be kicked off&mdash;requested
    to resign from half a dozen boards for having such a
    son-in-law&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"There's freedom for you," said Ben.</p>

    <p>"And," continued Mr. Cord, "if it were known that I
    consented to the marriage, and actually consorted with such
    fellows! You must realize, Crystal, that most of the most
    influential men in the country think the way Eddie does. Half
    my boards are composed of older Eddies."</p>

    <p>"You'll do better to resign from them, then," said
    Crystal.</p>

    <p>Ben had been very much struck by Crystal's suggestion.</p>

    <p>"Really, Mr. Cord," he said, "I believe
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"
       id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>that is a great idea of
       Crystal's. I really believe if capital had more idea of the
       real views of labor&mdash;as you said, you eventually adopt
       all our ideas, why wouldn't an intimate knowledge of
       individuals hurry that process?"</p>

    <p>"Simply because I should lose all influence with my own
    people by merely investigating you in a friendly spirit."</p>

    <p>"Glory!" exclaimed Ben, with open contempt for such people.
    "Think of penalizing the first honest attempt to
    understand!"</p>

    <p>"You see the point of my plan, don't you, Ben?" said
    Crystal.</p>

    <p>"You bet I do."</p>

    <p>"That's wonderful," she answered, "for you've only heard
    half of it. In July, August, and September, we will come here
    to Newport, and you will get to understand father's&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Hold on," cried Ben, "just a moment. That is absolutely
    impossible, Crystal. You don't understand. The paper couldn't
    keep me a day if I did that."</p>

    <p>"Ha!" cried Mr. Cord, coming suddenly to life. "There's
    freedom for you!"</p>

    <p>"That would be very cruel of the owners, Ben, but if they
    did&mdash;"</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"
       id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>

    <p>"It wouldn't be cruel at all," said Moreton. "They wouldn't
    have any choice. I should have lost all influence with my
    readers, if it were known&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Glory!" said Mr. Cord. "Think of penalizing the first
    honest attempt to understand the capitalistic class!"</p>

    <p>Ben stood silent, caught in the grip of an intellectual
    dilemma which he felt every instant would dissolve itself and
    which didn't.</p>

    <p>Crystal for the first time moved away from her father.
    "Those are my terms," she said. "I stay with the man who agrees
    to them, and if you both decline them&mdash;well, I'll go off
    and try and open the oyster by myself."</p>

    <p>There was a long momentous pause, and then Tomes's discreet
    knock on the door.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Verriman on the telephone, madam."</p>

    <p>"I can't come," said Crystal. "Ask him to send a
    message."</p>

    <p>"Don't you see, Crystal, what your plan would do?" said her
    father. "Either it would make Moreton a red revolutionist and
    me a persecuting Bourbon, or else it would just ruin us both
    for either of our objectives."</p>

    <p>"It won't ruin you for my objectives,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"
       id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>said Crystal, "and women are
       more human, you know, than men."</p>

    <p>Another knock at the door. Tomes's voice again:</p>

    <p>"Mr. Verriman wishes to know if he might dine here this
    evening?"</p>

    <p>"No," said Cord, looking at Crystal.</p>

    <p>Crystal raised her voice. "Certainly, Tomes. Say we shall be
    delighted to have him&mdash;at eight."</p>

    <p>Both men turned to her.</p>

    <p>"Why did you do that, Crystal?
    Verriman&mdash;here&mdash;to-night?"</p>

    <p>Crystal did not answer&mdash;the identity of their tones,
    their words, and their irritation with her should have told
    them the answer, but didn't.</p>

    <p>She knew that only opposition to Eddie and Eddie's many
    prototypes could weld her two men solidly together.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
